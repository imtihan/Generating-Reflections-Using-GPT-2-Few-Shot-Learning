0,0,3,well she got really angry at me because on the way to my room my idiot sister got in the way so I pushed her out of the way she's just annoying so then I went into my room the only place that I really feel safe slammed the door and then mums favorite picture fell on the floor,thank you for sharing that with me because it really and being for being so honest about your anger because what it does is help I don't know if it's helping you but it's certainly helping me to understand that this is really big for you and it's a big expression but surprisingly you know anger anger's a good thing in a way because it's it's letting you know that something wasn't right and wasn't fair that he he just did change the thing without your permission without you knowing so in some ways you had a right to be angry but what happens what I heard you saying in as you were telling me what happened next what happened next was that your anger took charge and he it did more than what it's meant to do your your anger is just just to let you know that you're angry okay but what it did what I feel it did it just pushed you out of the road and said I'm I'm taking control here so Jane when you were angry did you feel it anywhere in your body," Response : no, nothing. It felt very different inside myself now where before maybe after an argument or whatever cause we both knew exactly why our arguments happen sometimes they go back years ago which makes sense since everyone knows each other better by their own experiences anyway its hard enough having two people who share similar interests together talking over dinner while drinking wine and eating pizza  it feels weirdly uncomfortable even worse still seeing him sitting alone watching TV again making fun jokes around his friends instead listening intently listen up please tell us anything else? ok fine thanks sorry i think im done reading yet"
1,1,3,sure um as you know I'm Andrea I uh I'm a junior I'm in the marching band I played at center sacks I mean yeah I'm also in the little bit of a band geek I play you know the Wind Ensemble and the Jazz Band things like that,wow you really are involved in music,"Receptionist 1 (1): Hi, how may I assist? Thank You for coming. We would appreciate any assistance from anyone interested on helping us find someone else willing/able enough to participate. Please contact info@marijuanaforlifeusa"
2,2,3,it's overwhelming that getting all your stuff inside working out strategies,I think that you know girls are always overachievers and we can't just chill and like even my fans always like why don't you just relax they're plump up your deal but I'm trying to think that but I don't like it's a big deal school some things ago because I'm not really talented with my music okay dance or any of those things but so many people are into it so school is like my gift I do good and I understand it so to not feel secure and that is kind of,
3,3,3,slow down and maybe stay calm and just think that think of the letter e easy whatever that that word easy would make you feel,okay,"I've been thinking about writing something because if someone says ""you can write anything"" well, let's say they want to read your thoughts. You could go ahead right? So why am i saying yes please tell us some stories are great story ideas! And also try telling them things people might find interesting too which will help keep their interest level high as long time readers who may never get into reading fiction before probably aren´t interested either. But even though those two options sound pretty cool, actually most writers tend towards being very specific (like an author) while others prefer letting loose without having much detail behind each sentence   They usually start off simple enough where everyone knows exactly whats happening and once everything gets started however many words later its hard knowing whether every single thing has meaning beyond simply making sure nothing feels superfluous :P It takes longer than expected especially since sometimes authors use short sentences instead Of course after finishing first drafts often times only half-way done until final version The problem comes again"
4,4,3,no not really,what are you losing,"reflected response from her friend, she said ""I don´t know if we should do this or something"" then they both looked at eachothers eyes as though looking into their own hearts. They didn`T say anything else until after all was over"
5,5,3,I pick up a prescription,okay and what's your name, Response 2: My Name Is Michael C. Reply Delete
6,6,3,I think those two and um respect respect,okay can you tell me a little bit about why you picked those three," Response : Well first off, uh this is something where there was an article in The New York Times last week called ""The Biggest Health Risk You Can Avoid"" which talked specifically around diabetes. And one of the things people who read these articles said after reading them was basically 'I know someone whose life changed forever' or whatever but then also their family members say too many doctors treat diabetic patients as though somehow all diabetics should get treatment at once rather than treating each individual disease individually. So yeah obviously being diagnosed early enough before age 40 makes sense especially considering our current obesity epidemic,but now even more importantly let us talk about dieting right? Dieters tend towards eating less often (especially during periods such up-and -down cycles) while non dieter eat much higher amounts compared to other groups including vegetarians/vegans   This means most diets fail due mainly from lack o f nutrients available through food intake alone without any help by dietary changes resulting either via exercise training etc"
7,7,3,right I was trying not to do all those things so I thought you know it to stop I just have to it kind of took me over I took it changed my focus and I had that to focus on so I didn't actually stop in the middle the highway but I you know,I am so proud of you that is awesome Taylor think I am just that couldn't be happier and wait till we tell the group,
8,8,3,I think it's good because my sugars aren't about 14 every day so it must be working it must work her maybe even a couple of days so it's pretty effective,do you feel like you've seen some real improvements on that," Reflections : yeah, definitely. It feels great being able get back onto track again after such long periods where sugar levels weren´t high enough or too low which means less energy intake overall So thanks guys!"
9,9,3,well I have some ideas on that if you'd be open to hearing them,sure,
10,10,3,so you're stuck there,yeah it kind of like I would like realized that like drinking and using marijuana hasn't like got me anywhere positive really but it's like the only thing that like I know I just that's all I do usually and it's all in that mix we ever like feel better," Reflecting: what about alcohol? What does pot affect for someone trying new drugs or doing them on their own. Is weed an addiction, if yes how long has cannabis been around as opposed Alcohol use being addictive? How many times per day will smoking cigarettes cause problems when compared Cannabis usage causing no problem whatsoever. Do these two substances lead into each others' addictions,what effect both may bring upon those addicted individuals"
11,11,3,now what side effects did your doctor tell you that this medication made cause,I don't know I mean he you know he did say that hopefully would be better for my my legs right," Reflects : how long has she said no? What does her opinion look from here? Is everything good yet, well we haven´t seen them before. So why didn` t anyone see him earlier,what happened after his surgery. Did someone call 911 first thing last night (or later)   and ask questions during their interview process which may explain away certain details such As who called whom etc.? How many times will police officers check IDs prior/after seeing witnesses; whether witness identification cards show names listed by name only ; If officer asks person ""What type""of license plate number(if applicable); Does Officer need ID card showing driver�name & date of birth - Driver must provide photo proof including passport size photograph / driving record photos.; Do Police Officers require drivers' licenses issued outside US without expiration dates printed prominently above windshield wiper blades.(If available). Are Drivers required fingerprinted upon arrival into city limits area – No! The City cannot deny entry based solely off fingerprints alone"
12,12,3,I'd say about like like a six or a seven oh I like to work on it but you know if I get around to it I get around to if I don't I don't,uh-huh well why did you say six or seven rather than like a four," Reflecting again, how do we talk through these issues? What are our options for dealing effectively without resortating into violence. How does one deal constructively while still being able/willing enough to engage others as they need us most? And then finally where should someone go from here after having been arrested because their actions have caused harm (or at least hurt) other individuals. If anyone has any thoughts please share them below!"
13,13,3,that's what really only leaves me at five or six,okay so what can we do to get you at say like a nine or ten level of confidence,"I don't even remember how many times i got up from bed when people were talking on their cell phones, then again sometimes things are hard for us as parents especially since kids tend towards being shy. So let alone trying new activities which means doing them every night before school starts? It seems impossible right now! But here comes another question; What would happen without these exercises? Would everything still feel good enough,would everyone stay healthy.Would anyone actually enjoy themselves anymore! And finally ; How long will those exercise sessions last until someone gets sick (or worse) :D"
14,14,3,um I guess yes help me figure out whether or not like I do want to stop drinking or using drugs I mean that might be something that I have to do right now I don't really want to so I don't know if I could like get to a place where I actually do want to stop it'd be easier to actually do it then,like a like a place in terms of your thinking like your mentality," Reflections : how would i say? Like for example, let us talk specifically around sex. You mentioned before on here, which seems very important especially since most women find themselves sexually attracted towards men. So does being interested by someone else affect sexual attraction? Or perhaps even vice versa depending upon gender differences between genders (like male interest may increase female desire ) What kinds/levels / levels of arousal from another person affects sexuality differently among different individuals based solely off their own individual experiences rather compared against others' experience such feelings related only toward them also seem relevant given current research findings regarding brain structure changes associated both directly through hormones involved via testosterone production [1] –[4]. In addition studies suggest increased activity throughout parts ""the limbic system"" including amygdala; hippocampus region implicated in emotional processing involving reward anticipation resulting primarily due either direct effects mediated indirectly thru dopamine release pathways leading to enhanced motivation & pleasure seeking behavior induced mainly after exposure stimuli eliciting greater activation following stimulation cues suggesting heightened sensitivity across regions contributing to higher"
15,15,3,yeah I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't imagine like not drinking and using drugs I'm sure I would like leave court that day thinking I would but I don't know what happened when I get home for the next day or that day,let's go back a couple of steps how long have you been using the alcohol marijuana," Response 2: oh wow ok cool thanks thank you very much good morning sweetheart i hope there wasn´t anything wrong please come over tomorrow night if any problems arise from tonight, sorry no worries. Thank You!"
16,16,3,and what what promise you to pick a five or six,I just like been tried to lose weight before and those things certainly have failed as I still I'm the same way,",I've lost some pounds since starting off. So if anyone wants to try something else for themselves let them go ahead at their own pace whatever works best will work better than trying everything all over again which isn´t going anywhere anytime soon anyway"
17,17,3,the golden retriever,oh nice,"I'm sorry, did we just talk too long?"
18,18,3,all right so between now I'm going to see again do you have any hearings or anything coming up,no they're not for like a few more weeks,",I mean if something happens which would make us feel uncomfortable maybe next week. So basically as far back from here until after Christmas (laughs)"
19,19,3,oh I would definitely say a ten,okay," Reflections : So let us start off today, first thing will probably help get rid or reduce stress. First step which might sound obvious because most people who go into recovery usually try to avoid any sort oof physical activity until after their illness has passed? What does exercising actually entail? Well basically once someone gets sick enough something happens inside them where everything starts changing. It changes our physiology,our brain chemistry change too cause every cell within each body part becomes different depending upon its function (or lack thereof) causing pain receptors around those areas become activated making muscles contract harder giving blood flow easier allowing oxygen to enter cells creating new tissue forming bones etc.. This process takes time though sometimes taking days maybe months before symptoms appear again The next important point regarding exercises itself isn tis very simple; Exercise helps keep energy levels high throughout the day while keeping hunger low during times of rest periods such being sleep deprivation periods When looking over many studies done since 2000 showing benefits associated wi fitness training programs including strength building workouts i"
