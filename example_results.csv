9,9,3,huh okay so on the one side some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed sort of carefree and kind of let loose a little bit more on the other hand there's a little bit more I guess planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can and then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck your your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend you drink too much okay any other not-so-good things about the alcohol,yeah people can get a little like sloppy I guess like they're all loose like with people and corners doing things that should be done in private and that kind of stuff,oh wow that sounds scary
10,10,3,like forget about problems,yeah,what are some things that would help?
11,11,3,I want you have a seat here sure so to start off I'm just going to verify your information real quick so we said your name's Larry seedorf is your date of birth let's see,129 68 okay,so how old were you when you started making music?

16,16,3,and when you use the opposites of a happening and what I want you to do is first put what preceded what that was happening before you decided to use it for this technique so whether it was an argument your mother or somebody cut you off you know you're getting stressed about a homework assignment whatever happens to be what happened before which behavior you choose to use which skill set you're going to implement and then how do you sell afterwards okay and it made you feel calmer happier got along better with your mother you were able to finish your assignment without anxiety that whatever that happened to be,okay,so you've been using these techniques for awhile now and you're feeling good about them and you're doing them regularly and you're starting to see results?

19,19,3,okay what made you say two instead of one,well I mean anything's possible I mean I I guess I could maybe be convinced yeah is there something I mean I are there things I can try that would make me like want to quit smoking,"no, no, no. No, no, no. You know, I've got nothing against quitting smoking, I love cigarettes, I smoke them every day, I enjoy them, they're great, I'll never stop smoking, I will always keep on trying to quit smoking, I won't give up!"
