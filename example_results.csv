16,16,3,and when you use the opposites of a happening and what I want you to do is first put what preceded what that was happening before you decided to use it for this technique so whether it was an argument your mother or somebody cut you off you know you're getting stressed about a homework assignment whatever happens to be what happened before which behavior you choose to use which skill set you're going to implement and then how do you sell afterwards okay and it made you feel calmer happier got along better with your mother you were able to finish your assignment without anxiety that whatever that happened to be,okay,"so you've done all these things in order to make yourself feel calmer, more relaxed, less anxious, and more comfortable?"

18,18,3,okay tell me a little bit about how smoking fits in your day it'll help with the,I mean I suppose a little less than a pack a day it's not too bad um the I probably smoked for the last five years but I I mean I could quit if I wanted to but I don't really want to right now,oh ok cool
19,19,3,okay what made you say two instead of one,well I mean anything's possible I mean I I guess I could maybe be convinced yeah is there something I mean I are there things I can try that would make me like want to quit smoking,"no, just stop smoking. You know, we all need help in our lives. We should never give up trying to live life as best as we can. It doesn't matter whether or not you succeed at doing this. If you fail then you failed. That's it. So quit smoking now. Quit smoking now. Stop smoking now."
