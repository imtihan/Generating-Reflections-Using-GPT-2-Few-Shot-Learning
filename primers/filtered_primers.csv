,prompt,response,reflection
0,hey Monica how are you doing today,I'm okay right now but I'm a little anxious because thinking about how Black Friday is soon and my friends want to go to the mall for Black Friday but I really can't go and I want to go but I really to interesting,so it sounds like you really want to go to Black Friday with your friends you're feeling a little anxious about it
1,all right is there anything you'd like to tell me about it,well I'm sure um I drew mountains and lake because when I think about things like Unicom I think of nature so I drew a scene that I think would keep me calm,so it sounds like nature and mountains are coming to you do you think that this will be helpful I'm black Franny
2,tell me about how you're using the insulin,okay um so usually at night I'll check my blood sugar and then if it's pretty high like about like 15 or so I'll use it that day so usually end up using it about three or four times a week,so you're testing a lot
3,okay so tell me why you're only using it when your blood sugar goes high,oh okay yeah so I was supposed to use it everyday at first I think um which I was like the first week that I had it I started injecting everyday I don't carry about a week it's your to hurt when I was inject here so that's when I started doing it less often thinking if I kind of gave this skin a couple days to heal it wouldn't hurt as much by the next time I I gave myself the injection,so you were experiencing some pain who knows what I'd like you to kind of use it a little left off
4,so you were experiencing some pain who knows what I'd like you to kind of use it a little left off,yeah it hurts a lot when I check,and you feel like that's really impacting your day
5,okay so sounds like you've seen some improvement your blood Sugar's have been sometimes under control what have you discuss with your doctor recently,um why has she haven't seen my doctor since I started the insulin so I guess I haven't told him I'm not using it every day like he wanted I hope you I hope you understand,well you're here today for the refill and it seems like you're really committed to getting your blood Sugar's under control
6,that's why we're here and if you want to walk with me back to the pharmacy I can get all your prescriptions rung up for you you,Welbeck I'm just not sure that I'm ready to quit I just I just don't think I can do this right now,so you're really not confident that you'd be successful long-term
7,and you got through it,yeah but there was just different circumstances,it is a different type of difficulty you're right and I don't want to make light of that but what I'm the point I'm trying to make with you is that it was difficult and you rose to the challenge and you got through it
8,well I do totally respect your decision if you really don't want to quit and you're not open to it then you know that is your choice whatever you choose to do about your smoking habit really is your choice and I do respect that so where do we go from here,well I don't want to quit right now but I know that in the past cutting down has helped me,cutting down that would be a great step I mean that would be wonderful so I know you've tried before what else have you learned what other lessons have you learned from quitting I'm guessing you've learned a lot of lessons
9,and why why do you want to lose weight,well so really recently actually my older sister has had a lot of health concerns relate to her weight and it just sort of jostled me a little bit because we're so similar,really related to your sister
10,what kind of problems sister experience,well so she has some high cholesterol and high blood pressure and I guess those are things that were running my family but I'm really worried because my grandmother has suffered from a stroke and I definitely don't want to do that,there's big change gears to get healthy
11,so I don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here so I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself basically my job is to meet with all of the students I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going different behaviors that you might be engaging in and thinking about any changes you might want to make for your life if you decide that you do it's not my job to change you I couldn't even if I wanted to that's not my role at all it's really to help you think about you know how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward that sound okay all right so why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself,sure um as you know I'm Andrea I uh I'm a junior I'm in the marching band I played at center sacks I mean yeah I'm also in the little bit of a band geek I play you know the Wind Ensemble and the Jazz Band things like that,wow you really are involved in music
12,very cool I've always wanted to be good at music all right so it sounds like you're in band and a few other musical ensembles any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun,um you know just hanging out with my friends or go to the beach things like that,it's kind of everyday sort of thing okay tell me a little bit about your family
13,okay great so you're doing well what sorts of goals do you have for after college or after high school,I'd like to you know I'd like to of course graduate high school hopefully go to a nice Ivy League school or I mean that might not happen and then I'd like to go on become a doctor study psychology you need to come a psychiatrist or something,okay you have some pretty big dreams
14,mm-hmm so about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink,the days that we drink are mostly like I said they're parties so it's more of that whole partying and dancing and you know having everyone have fun and then when we don't it's a lot more relaxed it's a lot more hanging out playing board games watching a movie it's not yeah,so it really depends on what the activity is whether or not alcohols get
15,mm-hmm,but in the moment it's quite fun to dance and have,okay so there's sort of pros and cons
16,right and then with the respect one of the things you mentioned is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries not sort of cross lines how do you think that the drinking fits in with that,in terms of what in terms of respect I think well in a way I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things I'm putting things in it that shouldn't be there and then but in terms of hot ways I am respecting myself I am I'm respecting myself by like trying to stay in someone's house and like trying to limit my drinking so I don't get to that blacked out like throwing up and everything and try to you know let loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not going to go with some random person I met in - I don't know where to do I don't know what and things like that,okay so you're sort of looking for that balance yeah how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit but about crossover okay and what have you come up with it at this point do you have sort of a limit that you stick to or
17,that's right um the bacteria in your mouth can use the soft drink to create acid that eats into the tooth surface and causes the holes the more that your teeth are coated in the sugar the more likely it is that you'll develop a hole did you know the one can of soft drink can have 10 teaspoons of sugar in it,I didn't know that so I shouldn't have soft drinks at all I'm not sure I could do that,yeah I understand it does sound like you're worried about getting holes in your teeth though there are a few options that you can do to help improve how you consume sugar would you like to hear about those
18,sure why don't you tell me a little bit about what you're thinking how soon you'd like to quit and why you want to quit,my cholesterol and my blood pressure are high my father and my uncle both had heart attacks when they were pretty young so my doctor's been telling me that if I quit I'll cut down on my chances of having a heart attack,that's correct quitting would be important for you and it will reduce your chances of having heart problems
19,hmm I'd be happy to do that first tell me exactly which products you used and more importantly how you use them,first I tried the gum I like to chew gum so I thought this would be good so I chewed about three to four pieces of gum a day but I was miserable and I started smoking after four days then I tried the patch a couple of months later I felt pretty good for about a week so I quit using it didn't think I needed it anymore started smoking two days later,based on what you've told me it sounds like you didn't get the full benefit of the product a few pieces of gum won't get enough nicotine into your body to make you comfortable you need at least nine pieces a day for it to be effective and it has to be used in a very specific way not chewed like regular chewing gum
20,I can I help you,yeah I hope so um my workplace is just gone smoke-free hey I'm not not very happy about it I'm going to keep smoking but I was worrying if there's anything that can help be like get through the day it's like you know go get my beer and smoke cigarettes after work,so your workplace just went smoke free you're not too pleased huh
21,okay tell me a little bit about how smoking fits in your day it'll help with the,I mean I suppose a little less than a pack a day it's not too bad um the I probably smoked for the last five years but I I mean I could quit if I wanted to but I don't really want to right now,okay so you feel like right now smoking is a pretty important part of your life it's not something you're ready to change but if the time came when you did decide to quit you feel pretty confident that you could go ahead and do that
22,nice to meet you so what brings you here today,well I just been feeling really stressed out lately because it's coming to the holidays and my teachers have decided to lower the class with everything these next couple weeks so it is overwhelmed with it all I had I have like feel like I have so much stuff to do and what are those personalities like for crafting a variant I can't with what I have to do and I wanted to well but I trust I'll be doing that and have the holidays I'm trying to prepare to my home Thanksgiving lots of stuff going on then and then boy is coming to visit me for Christmas,that's nice so hearing me say is that you're stressed with all this going on at school and preparing for the holidays that's that big it's really a lot on your plate
23,have you tried anything that might have works in past -,well we recently had fire home and we did the whole fascinating and I fasted like my computer completely I was a lot more with internet at all and to really do anything with electronics and I think that just having that goal in my mind and because it was forgotten I was able to really just not do it and I did so much homework during that week that I've ever done so maybe just really sitting at one with God could help me to better I should I should do it it's just so much easier said than done you know because we're college students who want to go have fun and we wanted to be with our friends but I mean I've had to cancel all my plans and this is why purple holidays at lunch sometime a benefit just frustrating me the teachers you know I mean I know that they did all something followed but there's just so much to do,it's overwhelming that getting all your stuff inside working out strategies
24,it's overwhelming that getting all your stuff inside working out strategies,I think that you know girls are always overachievers and we can't just chill and like even my fans always like why don't you just relax they're plump up your deal but I'm trying to think that but I don't like it's a big deal school some things ago because I'm not really talented with my music okay dance or any of those things but so many people are into it so school is like my gift I do good and I understand it so to not feel secure and that is kind of,so you put a lot of pressure on yourself when I hear saying it's cool because you like that -
25,completion with that and going the holiday do you feel like when you do how do you feel stressful week,toy was always really really relaxing so I think that'll be good it's kind of like a reward for getting through it but then I have I mean these goodies won't need a week and I feel like we'll be doing a lot in preparation for my boyfriend coming for Christmas so it won't be everlasting back for three more weeks of school and then like columns here and no it's like breach I mean it should be,so it seems like you have a lot going on this week but you seem motivated and now to complete it and you have the break to look forward to but you said it so that sounds like you you're almost there you're going to make it so it's good hearing from you [Music]
26,okay all right so that's that's that's my ministrations but just just kind of bear with me so when I gather from your best far as that you know already you're fully aware of the things that you need to do in order to live a healthy lifestyle and take care of yourself however you seem to find it difficult and you don't think that it works for you is that that's kind of the fish that I'm getting so explain to me what are some of the barriers that you feel exists that prevents you from eating healthier and losing weight,it's mostly the money it's expensive to buy foods that are healthy and I just can't afford it consistently also like foods it tastes good I hope these stuff doesn't taste good and I just don't want it and also my kids want the good taste in food so they wouldn't even eat it if I made healthy food,okay okay then I understand completely that finances can be a potential issue and an issue especially when it comes to eating healthy more importantly picking out the right healthy foods for your kids to end and also to have good taste is also a priority to you so tell me about you know we're going to switch and transition from diet and talk about exercise tell me about your normal exercise routine
27,nice to meet you so what brings you here today,well I just been feeling really stressed out lately because it's coming to the holidays and my teachers have decided to lower the class with everything these next couple weeks so it is overwhelmed with it all I had I have like feel like I have so much stuff to do and what are those personalities like for crafting a variant I can't with what I have to do and I wanted to well but I trust I'll be doing that and have the holidays I'm trying to prepare to my home Thanksgiving lots of stuff going on then and then boy is coming to visit me for Christmas,that's nice so hearing me say is that you're stressed with all this going on at school and preparing for the holidays that's that big it's really a lot on your plate
28,have you tried anything that might have works in past -,well we recently had fire home and we did the whole fascinating and I fasted like my computer completely I was a lot more with internet at all and to really do anything with electronics and I think that just having that goal in my mind and because it was forgotten I was able to really just not do it and I did so much homework during that week that I've ever done so maybe just really sitting at one with God could help me to better I should I should do it it's just so much easier said than done you know because we're college students who want to go have fun and we wanted to be with our friends but I mean I've had to cancel all my plans and this is why purple holidays at lunch sometime a benefit just frustrating me the teachers you know I mean I know that they did all something followed but there's just so much to do,it's overwhelming that getting all your stuff inside working out strategies
29,it's overwhelming that getting all your stuff inside working out strategies,I think that you know girls are always overachievers and we can't just chill and like even my fans always like why don't you just relax they're plump up your deal but I'm trying to think that but I don't like it's a big deal school some things ago because I'm not really talented with my music okay dance or any of those things but so many people are into it so school is like my gift I do good and I understand it so to not feel secure and that is kind of,so you put a lot of pressure on yourself when I hear saying it's cool because you like that -
30,completion with that and going the holiday do you feel like when you do how do you feel stressful week,toy was always really really relaxing so I think that'll be good it's kind of like a reward for getting through it but then I have I mean these goodies won't need a week and I feel like we'll be doing a lot in preparation for my boyfriend coming for Christmas so it won't be everlasting back for three more weeks of school and then like columns here and no it's like breach I mean it should be,so it seems like you have a lot going on this week but you seem motivated and now to complete it and you have the break to look forward to but you said it so that sounds like you you're almost there you're going to make it so it's good hearing from you [Music]
31,you know you you were honest about being a manipulator you were honest about the other programs you went to what's it like now for you what was it like what was different about this place,you know I'm not really sure but there is something different I mean I don't know if it's with me or just with my like a psychic kind of change you know going in there except not being out of maybe desperation but just out of my own choice just to be like all right I'm gonna do something different with my life this time and really try and then I had a hard time for a little bit and I really worked with Carrie like to address some of my other issues that might be going on you know other than if I'm relapsing that much maybe there's something else going on with me besides just my addiction you know,but you've worked hard it hasn't been easy
32,yeah it seems it seems a little less than perhaps you've been drinking with what you consider to be healthy drinking and certainly there's this conflicting information out there about what's healthy what's not healthy imagine the increased stresses what because we're concerned or to seal as your stresses increases and if you were to prescribe you anything maybe some interaction between the two but also build and serve them I would think so if you would what is it that you like about alcohol,well you know it does at least in the moment temporarily reduce my stress and I you know like a good glass of wine I don't don't drink the cheap stuff I like the expensive what,so you like the taste of it mm-hmm and it does help to lower the stress signal which is for that time you're drinking one of those so good things about alcohol for you
33,so you like the taste of it mm-hmm and it does help to lower the stress signal which is for that time you're drinking one of those so good things about alcohol for you,um well you know the nights that maybe I have a couple more glasses than I should I wake up feeling kind of yuck and of course part of my stress is finances and I mentioned I like the good stuff and so if I'm drinking more than I'm increasing my financial burden,yeah so your financial stress may be increased by the fact that you're drinking
34,so Chris they wanted to talk to you you know you're one of our starter athletes of really value you as a team player as athletic director one of my job's is to kind of keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best and something came up this weekend I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and I understand you were there and so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now,okay Oh actually could I confide something in you that has been bothering me lately well prior to that party like as you know I'm an honor student and my parents did keep me very like kept down out of the lake so like social life and about a month ago my friends they invited me into a party and I used the fact that all I'm always doing my homework and always studying that to allow me to go to the party and um well that party I managed to convince my parents that I would spend the night at my friend's house so I that's when I started drinking it was a unique experience as you could say I guess you can say and I don't know I was fun at least in the moment so I kept doing it then this past weekend instead of studying for an exam I asked my I begged my mom to let me go to another party and she kind of knew what I was doing she asked me to like to promise her no alcohol no drugs man I'll pick you up by 12 and I was surprised twelve was told us basically when the party starts but I told her whatever I thought I thought to myself that I'll come home figure out to delay her call me pick me up later so later so she I promise she dropped me off I promised her no alcohol no nothing so we go I have fun like I've been having and I was drinking and then it's time the time came for her to pick me up and as soon I couldn't delay her for pick me up and as soon as she picked me up and I step in the car she said you drank vodka and I'm like I I didn't know what to say I just looked at the floor and I feel terrible because I I betrayed my mother I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol and that's exactly what I did,so here you are you're an honor student you're star athlete you've kind of been doing everything you've been told for all these years and maybe last month sometime you started getting more involved in the party scene and it was fun at first but now you're already noticing some consequence
35,so here you are you're an honor student you're star athlete you've kind of been doing everything you've been told for all these years and maybe last month sometime you started getting more involved in the party scene and it was fun at first but now you're already noticing some consequence,right like I've been noticing I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork I haven't really I kind of just sit in class like my mind is elsewhere especially on the weekends we're instead about instead of studying I'm caught up with my friends trying to find what we can I get alcohol based on their age and stuff like that,it's really changed your focus yeah what do you like about drinking
36,it's really changed your focus yeah what do you like about drinking,I don't know it it's I'm a very reserved person for the most part not well not when I'm doing sports but like you know like a social environment I tend to keep to myself because I'm very self-conscious I would say and when I when I drink I feel I don't know like it relaxes me I'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily,so helps you kind of used to not feel more relaxed
37,any other things,just different group of friends of group of girlfriends thank you different people that I'm hanging out with because certain people are associated with that type of so that's that that's also changed,so your your friends that you were hanging out with there's a little tension there now
38,in the session before we were talking a little bit about your alcohol use hoping you could you could tell me a little bit more about that,yeah it's it's kind of him I kind of had some issues this week again - I was I was at a party and I feel so stupid that I was like you know I did not mean to get that drunk I swear I was just gonna have you know two drinks that's what I told myself and I made an idiot of myself I I was an idiot I am oh my god I was completely flirting with my boss's husband like so I was told the next day I'm I would never do that you know and God talking to you about it right now I feel like I could use a drink you know I would I would love to have one right now honestly but you know and you know maybe a part of it I said I was just gonna have two drinks right I had two drinks at the party you know two vodka tonics and I didn't even it was like I had nothing though you know and so I had another and then I guess that's just kind of when I you know I didn't mean to and I feel stupid but you know I flirted with my boss's husband my boss actually thought it was kind of funny the next day thank God it's like not a problem but I'm mortified you know,doesn't feel good for you
39,has has this alcohol use interfere any other air in life socially or an employer or anything,no I'm and I mean I'm not working you know home with the kids but the kids are you know in school till 3:00 and you know knowing my friend's party like I do well my mother-in-law's she's just kind of pissed last night I don't know what I said to her,so when you're when you're talking earlier you'd mention that you were feeling anxious lucid anxious trouble sleeping look like you're shaking a little bit there was this a result of you cutting back
40,how did that happen,I went out at lunch with my coworker and we walked by the bar and this woman had a martini and it just looked so good and I thought I was gonna have one you know I said I was not gonna drink at work I was not gonna drink at work you know I saw that martini so I thought I'd have one and I don't know what happened but I know I went back to the office afterwards you know I know that my husband was called to come pick me up and he brought home a box of all my stuff,it's a bad experience for him
41,get out of it you mean gonna have the charge,yeah I mean I feel like they're probably gonna make me like go to rehab or something like that I want to do that,so you feel like you can get out of the rehab part too-
42,so you feel like you can get out of the rehab part too-,um I don't know I really am Not sure I just know that I don't know getting in getting the DUI is kind of just made me realize I like me to make it change but I'm just not ready to stop drinking or using marijuana there's just like the only things that like really help me in my life,all right so with this recent arrest you realize it may be about you to stop using but really don't want to
43,alone safety of the marijuana,yeah I mean I'd like a few people that always smoke with but usually just kinda by myself I mean I smoke every day so thought it was with people I'm doing it,so doesn't sound like you're really worried about losing your social support if you stop using
44,what are you losing,I kind of just like use it to like cope I got like I have a brain injury that I got like a while ago like it still causes pain and that's just the only thing that ever seemed to help once after the injury,this is the alcohol in there one
45,any other reasons,um it's just easier it's just the marijuana like relaxes me it's just easier to kind of like forget about things when I'm using,like forget about problems
46,all right so you can't imagine that so was it at the other side can you imagine having further incensed with law enforcement more charges in the future,um I guess I hadn't really considered that I mean that I don't want there today I guess I would want this to kind of like go as smoothly as possible not get any more charges or anything like that not be in this situation again,so you could kind of picture an outcome where you beat these charges or there's not I really have a consequence and you'll be more careful in the future
47,so you could kind of picture an outcome where you beat these charges or there's not I really have a consequence and you'll be more careful in the future,Um I don't know yeah I guess so I guess I probably just wouldn't drive if I like was just turning like right before try to like avoid that situation again,so with that thinking you could continue to use as you were that you would take out the part that got you in trouble
48,so if you could have the pain and anxiety go away without the alcohol marijuana would you continue to use it,I just couldn't imagine getting to a place where that wasn't what was like helping me and then to like I don't I drink mostly by myself but I couldn't imagine like if my friends called me up and said hey do you want to go out tonight like not drinking with them,so there is a social component here
49,so you know if you had no anxiety no pain you'd have to give up at least those interactions with your friends how would they respond if you went out with them and didn't drink,um they probably just like wouldn't understand it because we all go out when we got like really drunken I would just feel like out of place,so it'd be socially awkward
50,but then you have this this recent situation which is making you second-guess some of it,yeah I mean it's making me think that like maybe I I need to like make a change I just can't see that that's the change I'm making,so you need to make some change
51,you have any theories,I mean I just thinking like just like cutting back on it and like not drinking and driving obviously because that's what like got me into this situation don't like other than that really and I really have really thought of what I could do,so you could reduce your usage avoid driving and that might that might get you to your goal would that be enough usage to stop the anxiety in the pain
52,is that just is that just me or does it seem that way to you to,now that I'm like talking through it yeah and I don't think I have any choice really,you don't have any choice what's gonna happen it's going to happen
53,that wouldn't look good either all right so you want to avoid those behaviors for sure so you know for sure you don't want it those things would it be acceptable to do those things,I mean not really I mean I think I could avoid the nollie drunk-driving enough or maybe not to drank the day of my court date but I don't know about the whole you marijuana part,that's tougher
54,goals that you could get behind,um I mean I can try I guess so like think about it and try to get out there I know I'm gonna be stressed out the day of my court dates are it's gonna be hard to like not drink that day,you're not striking me as overly enthusiastic about this idea
55,so now that your little calmer let's talk about what happened with mom before you came here this afternoon,okay well I mean she knows that I'm looking for a job and she knows that I'm going to school and just every time I walk in the door she asks me to do the dishes no matter what and I just we get in a huge argument over well you've been home for two more hours and I've been home so why didn't you do the dishes or why didn't you start the dishes and and we scream at each other and I scream we have screaming matches I always try to scream louder than her and then she gets upset,alright so it's back and forth in the situate a situation escalates and you slam doors and
56,okay well let's use this situation that has happened to you because today I wanted to actually work on awesome interpersonal would give them and I have a handout sheet to give you and it's called the give technique I want you to take a look at this handout you can take that home with you we're going to talk about this we can directly apply this to what happened today with your mom because this is going to happen again right same situation with your mom so it's a it's a an acronym give giv e why don't you read what those letters stand for,okay G gentle be gentle I interested act act interested the validate e easy manner use amazing manners,okay so this is just something that when a situation starts to escalate you can just say give
57,okay that's very good good what about act interested,I'm going to make eye contact with her,okay that's important so she knows that you're listening
58,right okay that would be something that you could do quickly and easily okay and what about validate it's an interesting word what what might that how might you validate what your mother is saying,I'm I can tell her that I understand that she would like me to help out around the house,yes because you know what if you live together is it important that you work together and get everything done nobody likes to do housework but you all have to do it so does she have a good point
59,yeah,I stopped I took a breath,T you took it breath and kind of like took a step back okay
60,okay great so you're doing well what sorts of goals do you have for after college or after high school,I'd like to you know I'd like to of course graduate high school hopefully go to a nice Ivy League school or I mean that might not happen and then I'd like to go on become a doctor study psychology you need to come a psychiatrist or something,okay you have some pretty big dreams
61,okay,I place great importance in that,okay great so sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of belonging like you said a sense of purpose anyway and then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing it's not just Authority but respecting yourself respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you okay that's great all right well one of the things I want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends so what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends
62,mm-hmm and so when you go to parties most of the time there's alcohol there okay and how often do you think you would say you're drinking,I'd say um on a not busy month for instance I'd say about like two weekends out of the month two three,mm-hmm so about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink
63,mm-hmm so about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink,the days that we drink are mostly like I said they're parties so it's more of that whole partying and dancing and you know having everyone have fun and then when we don't it's a lot more relaxed it's a lot more hanging out playing board games watching a movie it's not yeah,so it really depends on what the activity is whether or not alcohols get
64,mm-hmm,but in the moment it's quite fun to dance and have,okay so there's sort of pros and cons
65,okay so sort of in the the too much drinking or our times can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol,um a lot of times it will make make people stupid yeah you know people make dumb decisions and things like that we we usually try to be as safe about it as possible so like sleepover friends house and so you know we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group so we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks but um definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're stupid when they're drunk can can be really stupid,hmm so you're trying to like you said not engage in really dangerous activities you're trying to stay put you're not driving you're trying to stay with people that you trust but yet it sounds like there's still some some things happening
66,huh okay so on the one side some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed sort of carefree and kind of let loose a little bit more on the other hand there's a little bit more I guess planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can and then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck your your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend you drink too much okay any other not-so-good things about the alcohol,yeah people can get a little like sloppy I guess like they're all loose like with people and corners doing things that should be done in private and that kind of stuff,so you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't mean busy
67,got it okay all right well you mentioned a couple times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the a dangerous aspect of the drinking why did you make those decisions,I just I you know have an aunt who is an alcoholic so I I see like the issues that are involved and I've seen movies and things I know that drunk driving is an issue so I you know I want to be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like I someone's house or someone's parents home or something but so I like I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I want to limit that and still be able to have fun,okay yeah it sounds kind of similar to your your value of respect too so on the one hand you the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start if there's too much then
68,mm-hmm,and um you know have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group as a community,uh-huh so kind of combined he has goals okay so you're you have a goal it sounds like of actually cutting back on your drinking how important is it to you to work on that goal on on the scale of one to ten where one is not at all important antennas it's the most important thing right now
69,uh-huh,I still you know like I said I don't want my body tried specially going to my school like I know how things affect your body and also affect your your social and your schoolwork and things like that I know that once I get to college it's not it's not gonna gonna work out being you know drinking every weekend and I'm like trying to wake up early and go to school take an exam I know that's not that's not feasible it's not a good idea,yeah looking ahead you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for years now okay well how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to
