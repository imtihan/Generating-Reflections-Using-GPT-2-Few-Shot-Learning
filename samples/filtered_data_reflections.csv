155,okay what are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol,um it's you know when we drink we we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not you know everyone's drinking together we're a lot more loosened up and relaxed and not really thinking about stresses or things like that but it can be when it's too much drinking it can be can be obviously bad
156,um it's you know when we drink we we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not you know everyone's drinking together we're a lot more loosened up and relaxed and not really thinking about stresses or things like that but it can be when it's too much drinking it can be can be obviously bad,okay so sort of in the the too much drinking or our times can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol
157,okay so sort of in the the too much drinking or our times can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol,um a lot of times it will make make people stupid yeah you know people make dumb decisions and things like that we we usually try to be as safe about it as possible so like sleepover friends house and so you know we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group so we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks but um definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're stupid when they're drunk can can be really stupid
158,um a lot of times it will make make people stupid yeah you know people make dumb decisions and things like that we we usually try to be as safe about it as possible so like sleepover friends house and so you know we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group so we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks but um definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're stupid when they're drunk can can be really stupid,hmm so you're trying to like you said not engage in really dangerous activities you're trying to stay put you're not driving you're trying to stay with people that you trust but yet it sounds like there's still some some things happening
159,hmm so you're trying to like you said not engage in really dangerous activities you're trying to stay put you're not driving you're trying to stay with people that you trust but yet it sounds like there's still some some things happening,sometimes yeah
160,sometimes yeah,can you tell me a little bit about that
161,can you tell me a little bit about that,well I especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends like we drink too much and we hadn't up like throwing up and things like that that I don't that's not fun
162,well I especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends like we drink too much and we hadn't up like throwing up and things like that that I don't that's not fun,yeah throwing up is never fun it's not and how often do you think that happened
163,yeah throwing up is never fun it's not and how often do you think that happened,for me that's happened to me once it was the first time I ever drank and it was it was a lot and you know what I was doing I was mixing all kinds of weird things I'm just kind of taking anything ever anyone gave me and that didn't end well but after that I have it but I do have friends that that still do sometimes so I'll end up like having to take care of them or something and
164,for me that's happened to me once it was the first time I ever drank and it was it was a lot and you know what I was doing I was mixing all kinds of weird things I'm just kind of taking anything ever anyone gave me and that didn't end well but after that I have it but I do have friends that that still do sometimes so I'll end up like having to take care of them or something and,okay
165,okay,it kind of put it down around my my fun
166,it kind of put it down around my my fun,huh okay so on the one side some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed sort of carefree and kind of let loose a little bit more on the other hand there's a little bit more I guess planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can and then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck your your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend you drink too much okay any other not-so-good things about the alcohol
167,huh okay so on the one side some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed sort of carefree and kind of let loose a little bit more on the other hand there's a little bit more I guess planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can and then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck your your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend you drink too much okay any other not-so-good things about the alcohol,yeah people can get a little like sloppy I guess like they're all loose like with people and corners doing things that should be done in private and that kind of stuff
168,yeah people can get a little like sloppy I guess like they're all loose like with people and corners doing things that should be done in private and that kind of stuff,so you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't mean busy
169,so you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't mean busy,yeah
170,yeah,got it okay all right well you mentioned a couple times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the a dangerous aspect of the drinking why did you make those decisions
171,got it okay all right well you mentioned a couple times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the a dangerous aspect of the drinking why did you make those decisions,I just I you know have an aunt who is an alcoholic so I I see like the issues that are involved and I've seen movies and things I know that drunk driving is an issue so I you know I want to be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like I someone's house or someone's parents home or something but so I like I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I want to limit that and still be able to have fun
172,I just I you know have an aunt who is an alcoholic so I I see like the issues that are involved and I've seen movies and things I know that drunk driving is an issue so I you know I want to be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like I someone's house or someone's parents home or something but so I like I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I want to limit that and still be able to have fun,okay yeah it sounds kind of similar to your your value of respect too so on the one hand you the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start if there's too much then
173,okay yeah it sounds kind of similar to your your value of respect too so on the one hand you the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start if there's too much then,it sort of defeats the purpose
174,it sort of defeats the purpose,right and then with the respect one of the things you mentioned is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries not sort of cross lines how do you think that the drinking fits in with that
175,right and then with the respect one of the things you mentioned is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries not sort of cross lines how do you think that the drinking fits in with that,in terms of what in terms of respect I think well in a way I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things I'm putting things in it that shouldn't be there and then but in terms of hot ways I am respecting myself I am I'm respecting myself by like trying to stay in someone's house and like trying to limit my drinking so I don't get to that blacked out like throwing up and everything and try to you know let loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not going to go with some random person I met in - I don't know where to do I don't know what and things like that
176,okay so you're sort of looking for that balance yeah how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit but about crossover okay and what have you come up with it at this point do you have sort of a limit that you stick to or,usually well I start off by make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in it how much is in it so that way I control how much I drink so I'll usually just you know get one of those cups and then make one drink and then I'll try to make it last as long as possible and I'll be like all right this is my one drink and I'm good in that way I still have something in my cup some people aren't going to be like oh here have some more like no I'm good I have mine and I'll still be you know having some to like let loose a little
177,usually well I start off by make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in it how much is in it so that way I control how much I drink so I'll usually just you know get one of those cups and then make one drink and then I'll try to make it last as long as possible and I'll be like all right this is my one drink and I'm good in that way I still have something in my cup some people aren't going to be like oh here have some more like no I'm good I have mine and I'll still be you know having some to like let loose a little,mm-hmm and do you feel like that's working pretty well for you or you sometimes exceed that limit or or what do you think
178,mm-hmm and do you feel like that's working pretty well for you or you sometimes exceed that limit or or what do you think,for the most part it works pretty well because like I said people you know people come asking me trying to pressure me I'll be like no I'm good I have you know I still have so I'm like I'll get some later and then never end up getting anything but sometimes they'll be like hey let's take a shot and everyone's got it around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot and then at that point I'll be like oh well maybe I can take one more and that's when I start you know falling into
179,for the most part it works pretty well because like I said people you know people come asking me trying to pressure me I'll be like no I'm good I have you know I still have so I'm like I'll get some later and then never end up getting anything but sometimes they'll be like hey let's take a shot and everyone's got it around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot and then at that point I'll be like oh well maybe I can take one more and that's when I start you know falling into,okay
180,okay,too much
181,too much,so a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you like
182,so a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you like,I'd
183,I'd,like to make some adjustments to to make it a little smoother okay so kind of thinking along those lines how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself
184,like to make some adjustments to to make it a little smoother okay so kind of thinking along those lines how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself,um I'd like to make sure that I you know in terms of respecting myself of my body I'd like to you know try to drink less
185,um I'd like to make sure that I you know in terms of respecting myself of my body I'd like to you know try to drink less,okay
186,okay,like I you know it is nice to let loose and have fun but I'd also like it to be so you know I'm not damaging my body and I like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like 22
187,like I you know it is nice to let loose and have fun but I'd also like it to be so you know I'm not damaging my body and I like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like 22,mm-hmm
188,mm-hmm,and um you know have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group as a community
189,and um you know have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group as a community,uh-huh so kind of combined he has goals okay so you're you have a goal it sounds like of actually cutting back on your drinking how important is it to you to work on that goal on on the scale of one to ten where one is not at all important antennas it's the most important thing right now
190,uh-huh so kind of combined he has goals okay so you're you have a goal it sounds like of actually cutting back on your drinking how important is it to you to work on that goal on on the scale of one to ten where one is not at all important antennas it's the most important thing right now,I'd say about like like a six or a seven oh I like to work on it but you know if I get around to it I get around to if I don't I don't
191,I'd say about like like a six or a seven oh I like to work on it but you know if I get around to it I get around to if I don't I don't,uh-huh well why did you say six or seven rather than like a four
192,uh-huh well why did you say six or seven rather than like a four,um because I still think it's it's important
193,um because I still think it's it's important,uh-huh
194,uh-huh,I still you know like I said I don't want my body tried specially going to my school like I know how things affect your body and also affect your your social and your schoolwork and things like that I know that once I get to college it's not it's not gonna gonna work out being you know drinking every weekend and I'm like trying to wake up early and go to school take an exam I know that's not that's not feasible it's not a good idea
195,I still you know like I said I don't want my body tried specially going to my school like I know how things affect your body and also affect your your social and your schoolwork and things like that I know that once I get to college it's not it's not gonna gonna work out being you know drinking every weekend and I'm like trying to wake up early and go to school take an exam I know that's not that's not feasible it's not a good idea,yeah looking ahead you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for years now okay well how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to
196,yeah looking ahead you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for years now okay well how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to,I think
197,I think,on that same scale from one to ten
198,on that same scale from one to ten,I think if I made the decision I was going to for sure then I think definitely like a ten I know I
199,I think if I made the decision I was going to for sure then I think definitely like a ten I know I,oh wow okay why did you say ten
200,oh wow okay why did you say ten,it's just because I know that once I make the decision I know I can making the decision in the first place okay weather
201,it's just because I know that once I make the decision I know I can making the decision in the first place okay weather,okay and so you mentioned you know quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that
202,okay and so you mentioned you know quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that,um I'm thinking of maybe like trying to convince my friends without sounding you know dorky or something be like hey you know let's just stay in today like let's not go out or something or just be like hey I'm not like I'm not going to drink today and even if my friends do like being okay with them drinking around me not doing it and then then being okay with me drinking me not drinking and them doing whatever they want
203,um I'm thinking of maybe like trying to convince my friends without sounding you know dorky or something be like hey you know let's just stay in today like let's not go out or something or just be like hey I'm not like I'm not going to drink today and even if my friends do like being okay with them drinking around me not doing it and then then being okay with me drinking me not drinking and them doing whatever they want,so sort of trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking okay does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or
204,so sort of trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking okay does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or,I think so I think it's it's very feasible I think it's possible
205,I think so I think it's it's very feasible I think it's possible,okay um so I guess we'll talk about less alcohol activities and just making some notes to myself and then maybe I'm reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved okay so that's that goal sounds feasible you said would it be okay if we met in a couple weeks to sort of see how it's going
206,okay um so I guess we'll talk about less alcohol activities and just making some notes to myself and then maybe I'm reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved okay so that's that goal sounds feasible you said would it be okay if we met in a couple weeks to sort of see how it's going,I think so that's good

245,it's made it worse yeah,yes which is hard to see at the time I I do understand that but what I'm thinking is that if sometimes if we tell our anger look thank you you've done a good job it doesn't have to get so angry then because you you know you you're telling it that it's thank you you've done a good job you've let me know I'm angry now I'm going to deal with it from here
246,yes which is hard to see at the time I I do understand that but what I'm thinking is that if sometimes if we tell our anger look thank you you've done a good job it doesn't have to get so angry then because you you know you you're telling it that it's thank you you've done a good job you've let me know I'm angry now I'm going to deal with it from here,you have to help me with that a bit i think
247,you have to help me with that a bit i think,we will
248,we will,hi I'm Amy the pharmacist so I understand you have some questions
249,hi I'm Amy the pharmacist so I understand you have some questions,hi I'm Mario and my doctor suggested I talked to a pharmacist about quitting smoking do you have the time for this
250,hi I'm Mario and my doctor suggested I talked to a pharmacist about quitting smoking do you have the time for this,sure why don't you tell me a little bit about what you're thinking how soon you'd like to quit and why you want to quit
251,sure why don't you tell me a little bit about what you're thinking how soon you'd like to quit and why you want to quit,my cholesterol and my blood pressure are high my father and my uncle both had heart attacks when they were pretty young so my doctor's been telling me that if I quit I'll cut down on my chances of having a heart attack
252,that's correct quitting would be important for you and it will reduce your chances of having heart problems,so that's the situation I've tried to quit a couple of times before but it didn't work so what I was hoping is that you could go over the different options and help me pick the best one
253,so that's the situation I've tried to quit a couple of times before but it didn't work so what I was hoping is that you could go over the different options and help me pick the best one,hmm I'd be happy to do that first tell me exactly which products you used and more importantly how you use them
254,hmm I'd be happy to do that first tell me exactly which products you used and more importantly how you use them,first I tried the gum I like to chew gum so I thought this would be good so I chewed about three to four pieces of gum a day but I was miserable and I started smoking after four days then I tried the patch a couple of months later I felt pretty good for about a week so I quit using it didn't think I needed it anymore started smoking two days later
255,based on what you've told me it sounds like you didn't get the full benefit of the product a few pieces of gum won't get enough nicotine into your body to make you comfortable you need at least nine pieces a day for it to be effective and it has to be used in a very specific way not chewed like regular chewing gum,I admit I didn't read the directions last time
256,I admit I didn't read the directions last time,as for the patch sounds like it worked for you you just didn't stay on it long enough we recommend 10 to 12 weeks and this gets enough nicotine into your body to help reduce most of the withdrawal symptoms while you work on learning to live your life without cigarettes you were able to quit for a week with it so it seems like it might be a good choice now but there are others as well
257,as for the patch sounds like it worked for you you just didn't stay on it long enough we recommend 10 to 12 weeks and this gets enough nicotine into your body to help reduce most of the withdrawal symptoms while you work on learning to live your life without cigarettes you were able to quit for a week with it so it seems like it might be a good choice now but there are others as well,yeah my doctor said something about a pill I didn't like the taste of the gum much
258,yeah my doctor said something about a pill I didn't like the taste of the gum much,well that's understandable but you should know there are new flavors that my patients say tastes better to be honest all the medications are effective it's just a matter of what you prefer you've already tried the patch there's also a nicotine lozenge a nasal spray an oral inhaler in tablet form we have bupropion which you've probably heard called zyban and there's a newer medication varenicline or chantix
259,well that's understandable but you should know there are new flavors that my patients say tastes better to be honest all the medications are effective it's just a matter of what you prefer you've already tried the patch there's also a nicotine lozenge a nasal spray an oral inhaler in tablet form we have bupropion which you've probably heard called zyban and there's a newer medication varenicline or chantix,yeah I've heard of those but I think I'd rather stick with the patch and this time I'm gonna make sure I keep it on long enough it
260,yeah I've heard of those but I think I'd rather stick with the patch and this time I'm gonna make sure I keep it on long enough it,sounds like a good choice for you and given that you have some experience with it and you know that it works for you um how many cigarettes do you smoke a day
261,sounds like a good choice for you and given that you have some experience with it and you know that it works for you um how many cigarettes do you smoke a day,about a pack a day
262,about a pack a day,okay so you'll want to start with the 21 milligram patch for six weeks and then the 14 milligram patch for two weeks and then the seven milligram patch for the last two weeks it's pretty easy to use in the morning of your quit day I want you to put one patch on a hairless part of your upper body and leave it on for 24 hours and the next morning you take that off you put another patch on in a different location you want to switch site so you don't get any skin irritation if you have trouble sleeping you can take it off before you go to bed you read the directions on the box and if you have any questions let me know

271,okay tell me a little bit about how smoking fits in your day it'll help with the,I mean I suppose a little less than a pack a day it's not too bad um the I probably smoked for the last five years but I I mean I could quit if I wanted to but I don't really want to right now
272,okay so you feel like right now smoking is a pretty important part of your life it's not something you're ready to change but if the time came when you did decide to quit you feel pretty confident that you could go ahead and do that,sure I can quit

292,it's like if it was just the work if you find that I'm stressed about that too and I'm worried about me even think oh it sounds kind of silly but you know your boyfriend coming home for Christmas is kind of a big deal,for sure
293,for sure,and it's like I wanted to like my family but I I'm not excited you didn't put him to be bored you know I mean that's I shouldn't even be in my mind you know I should be totally focused on school right now it's just
294,and it's like I wanted to like my family but I I'm not excited you didn't put him to be bored you know I mean that's I shouldn't even be in my mind you know I should be totally focused on school right now it's just,so do you feel like you but obviously we're this far on this semester how well do you think you've done well thus far
295,so do you feel like you but obviously we're this far on this semester how well do you think you've done well thus far,yeah actually I've been doing a lot better in this semester and I think that because of it I wanted to want to keep to move on I want to get I like I'm over a cheer instance I like skip good grades but that makes the procrastination like I'm really good at working under pressure but I can't work under pressure with this up because if I don't start doing in advance I won't get it done and I'm trying to figure out how to just balance to you
296,yeah actually I've been doing a lot better in this semester and I think that because of it I wanted to want to keep to move on I want to get I like I'm over a cheer instance I like skip good grades but that makes the procrastination like I'm really good at working under pressure but I can't work under pressure with this up because if I don't start doing in advance I won't get it done and I'm trying to figure out how to just balance to you,do you think if you do what are some options that you see you may have preparing yourself to get the assignments done
297,do you think if you do what are some options that you see you may have preparing yourself to get the assignments done,oh I guess just I've considered you know being very turning off all of my electronics of when my computer I'll need it to do the whole market and doing like a to-do list and just really disciplining myself that you know I have to do it but as soon as I get my computer and like Facebook and gave you the things that distract me I keep finding myself putting it up and putting it off
298,oh I guess just I've considered you know being very turning off all of my electronics of when my computer I'll need it to do the whole market and doing like a to-do list and just really disciplining myself that you know I have to do it but as soon as I get my computer and like Facebook and gave you the things that distract me I keep finding myself putting it up and putting it off,have you tried anything that might have works in past -
299,have you tried anything that might have works in past -,well we recently had fire home and we did the whole fascinating and I fasted like my computer completely I was a lot more with internet at all and to really do anything with electronics and I think that just having that goal in my mind and because it was forgotten I was able to really just not do it and I did so much homework during that week that I've ever done so maybe just really sitting at one with God could help me to better I should I should do it it's just so much easier said than done you know because we're college students who want to go have fun and we wanted to be with our friends but I mean I've had to cancel all my plans and this is why purple holidays at lunch sometime a benefit just frustrating me the teachers you know I mean I know that they did all something followed but there's just so much to do
300,it's overwhelming that getting all your stuff inside working out strategies,I think that you know girls are always overachievers and we can't just chill and like even my fans always like why don't you just relax they're plump up your deal but I'm trying to think that but I don't like it's a big deal school some things ago because I'm not really talented with my music okay dance or any of those things but so many people are into it so school is like my gift I do good and I understand it so to not feel secure and that is kind of
301,so you put a lot of pressure on yourself when I hear saying it's cool because you like that -,hey I guess it is a lot of pressure I mean I remember in high school my brother was like the good pop and he's older than me he would come back with bad grades and I would come off straight A's I'm so excited you know tell me about your day Ethan Anthony was just like give him all these pitches he did so bad the whole time I always wanted to shine [Music] maybe I do need to just relax and know that the day-to-day thing

305,so your primary concern really is for the speak you have to get done this week I remember me just said earlier about creating possibly the creating the to-do list or do you think do you think those things that you mentioned earlier would be good,probably just do it talk about it but I guess it's just nice to know that

391,okay okay then I understand completely that finances can be a potential issue and an issue especially when it comes to eating healthy more importantly picking out the right healthy foods for your kids to end and also to have good taste is also a priority to you so tell me about you know we're going to switch and transition from diet and talk about exercise tell me about your normal exercise routine,honestly I only have one I haven't exercised in years just don't feel like it put all the money to join again

395,all right and then what what ultimate benefits let's talk about benefits what benefits that you feel that you can ultimately gain by by seeking out more nutritious foods and incorporating exercise into a daily regimen regimen and an overall losing weight what do you think would be the benefits of doing all that,I guess it's good for you dr.

402,hi I'm Andrea,until nice to meet you
403,until nice to meet you,nice to meet you so what brings you here today
404,nice to meet you so what brings you here today,well I just been feeling really stressed out lately because it's coming to the holidays and my teachers have decided to lower the class with everything these next couple weeks so it is overwhelmed with it all I had I have like feel like I have so much stuff to do and what are those personalities like for crafting a variant I can't with what I have to do and I wanted to well but I trust I'll be doing that and have the holidays I'm trying to prepare to my home Thanksgiving lots of stuff going on then and then boy is coming to visit me for Christmas
405,that's nice so hearing me say is that you're stressed with all this going on at school and preparing for the holidays that's that big it's really a lot on your plate,it's like if it was just the work if you find that I'm stressed about that too and I'm worried about me even think oh it sounds kind of silly but you know your boyfriend coming home for Christmas is kind of a big deal
406,it's like if it was just the work if you find that I'm stressed about that too and I'm worried about me even think oh it sounds kind of silly but you know your boyfriend coming home for Christmas is kind of a big deal,for sure
407,for sure,and it's like I wanted to like my family but I I'm not excited you didn't put him to be bored you know I mean that's I shouldn't even be in my mind you know I should be totally focused on school right now it's just
408,and it's like I wanted to like my family but I I'm not excited you didn't put him to be bored you know I mean that's I shouldn't even be in my mind you know I should be totally focused on school right now it's just,so do you feel like you but obviously we're this far on this semester how well do you think you've done well thus far
409,so do you feel like you but obviously we're this far on this semester how well do you think you've done well thus far,yeah actually I've been doing a lot better in this semester and I think that because of it I wanted to want to keep to move on I want to get I like I'm over a cheer instance I like skip good grades but that makes the procrastination like I'm really good at working under pressure but I can't work under pressure with this up because if I don't start doing in advance I won't get it done and I'm trying to figure out how to just balance to you
410,yeah actually I've been doing a lot better in this semester and I think that because of it I wanted to want to keep to move on I want to get I like I'm over a cheer instance I like skip good grades but that makes the procrastination like I'm really good at working under pressure but I can't work under pressure with this up because if I don't start doing in advance I won't get it done and I'm trying to figure out how to just balance to you,do you think if you do what are some options that you see you may have preparing yourself to get the assignments done
411,do you think if you do what are some options that you see you may have preparing yourself to get the assignments done,oh I guess just I've considered you know being very turning off all of my electronics of when my computer I'll need it to do the whole market and doing like a to-do list and just really disciplining myself that you know I have to do it but as soon as I get my computer and like Facebook and gave you the things that distract me I keep finding myself putting it up and putting it off
412,oh I guess just I've considered you know being very turning off all of my electronics of when my computer I'll need it to do the whole market and doing like a to-do list and just really disciplining myself that you know I have to do it but as soon as I get my computer and like Facebook and gave you the things that distract me I keep finding myself putting it up and putting it off,have you tried anything that might have works in past -
413,have you tried anything that might have works in past -,well we recently had fire home and we did the whole fascinating and I fasted like my computer completely I was a lot more with internet at all and to really do anything with electronics and I think that just having that goal in my mind and because it was forgotten I was able to really just not do it and I did so much homework during that week that I've ever done so maybe just really sitting at one with God could help me to better I should I should do it it's just so much easier said than done you know because we're college students who want to go have fun and we wanted to be with our friends but I mean I've had to cancel all my plans and this is why purple holidays at lunch sometime a benefit just frustrating me the teachers you know I mean I know that they did all something followed but there's just so much to do
414,it's overwhelming that getting all your stuff inside working out strategies,I think that you know girls are always overachievers and we can't just chill and like even my fans always like why don't you just relax they're plump up your deal but I'm trying to think that but I don't like it's a big deal school some things ago because I'm not really talented with my music okay dance or any of those things but so many people are into it so school is like my gift I do good and I understand it so to not feel secure and that is kind of
415,so you put a lot of pressure on yourself when I hear saying it's cool because you like that -,hey I guess it is a lot of pressure I mean I remember in high school my brother was like the good pop and he's older than me he would come back with bad grades and I would come off straight A's I'm so excited you know tell me about your day Ethan Anthony was just like give him all these pitches he did so bad the whole time I always wanted to shine [Music] maybe I do need to just relax and know that the day-to-day thing
416,hey I guess it is a lot of pressure I mean I remember in high school my brother was like the good pop and he's older than me he would come back with bad grades and I would come off straight A's I'm so excited you know tell me about your day Ethan Anthony was just like give him all these pitches he did so bad the whole time I always wanted to shine [Music] maybe I do need to just relax and know that the day-to-day thing,do you feel like you've done involve thus far the semester your classes
417,do you feel like you've done involve thus far the semester your classes,I think I've got some of my closest I'm not sharing because we don't really get product reports in them but both classes I do you know yeah I'm doing well and but you know there's so much riding on these next few weeks I don't do well on these assignments like it could totally mess up all that work so
418,I think I've got some of my closest I'm not sharing because we don't really get product reports in them but both classes I do you know yeah I'm doing well and but you know there's so much riding on these next few weeks I don't do well on these assignments like it could totally mess up all that work so,so your primary concern really is for the speak you have to get done this week I remember me just said earlier about creating possibly the creating the to-do list or do you think do you think those things that you mentioned earlier would be good
419,so your primary concern really is for the speak you have to get done this week I remember me just said earlier about creating possibly the creating the to-do list or do you think do you think those things that you mentioned earlier would be good,probably just do it talk about it but I guess it's just nice to know that
420,probably just do it talk about it but I guess it's just nice to know that,completion with that and going the holiday do you feel like when you do how do you feel stressful week
421,completion with that and going the holiday do you feel like when you do how do you feel stressful week,toy was always really really relaxing so I think that'll be good it's kind of like a reward for getting through it but then I have I mean these goodies won't need a week and I feel like we'll be doing a lot in preparation for my boyfriend coming for Christmas so it won't be everlasting back for three more weeks of school and then like columns here and no it's like breach I mean it should be
422,so it seems like you have a lot going on this week but you seem motivated and now to complete it and you have the break to look forward to but you said it so that sounds like you you're almost there you're going to make it so it's good hearing from you [Music],can you talk about the transformation that you see in people
423,can you talk about the transformation that you see in people,it's it keeps me coming back to work every day you know I get to see them walk in and I get to see that transformation slowly and it's beautiful you know you don't you can't beat that
424,it's it keeps me coming back to work every day you know I get to see them walk in and I get to see that transformation slowly and it's beautiful you know you don't you can't beat that,I mean realistically not everyone is a success story and we see its relapse it's a part of recovery but but for most cases though that difficult cases that do a good job and make that transformation when does that usually occur
425,I mean realistically not everyone is a success story and we see its relapse it's a part of recovery but but for most cases though that difficult cases that do a good job and make that transformation when does that usually occur,I think it's different for everyone I mean and we really can't tell who's going to make it by who has a better you know a bigger desire it's a journey and it's this process and so sometimes it happens where you see that light come on sometimes they're struggling and they're discharging and that's that's probably the most difficult part of the job is knowing that someone's not ready to be brought back to their environment and yet that's what has to happen you know it's a transitional period so
426,I think it's different for everyone I mean and we really can't tell who's going to make it by who has a better you know a bigger desire it's a journey and it's this process and so sometimes it happens where you see that light come on sometimes they're struggling and they're discharging and that's that's probably the most difficult part of the job is knowing that someone's not ready to be brought back to their environment and yet that's what has to happen you know it's a transitional period so,so they finished the first month of treatment and then it's time to go back to their life because they have to work or they have school or they have kids at home that's what you're talking about that's what's what's difficult or scary for you when they have to leave
427,so they finished the first month of treatment and then it's time to go back to their life because they have to work or they have school or they have kids at home that's what you're talking about that's what's what's difficult or scary for you when they have to leave,yeah because it's you know this is a family disease so when you know you leave that environment that was totally chaotic when you leave like the partner and the kids and the bills and the job and the everything and you remove yourself from that environment may you get popped back into it it's like the people around you assume that great you're finally home because now you can take care of the kids and pick up the you know dry cleaning and you know it's they expect you to be there the way you were and so much more and it's completely unrealistic and you know that they're not willing to change their behaviors if they're still going to be able to drink or have pills or whatever it is and it's it's not okay it's not safe and so that it's a difficult thing
428,yeah because it's you know this is a family disease so when you know you leave that environment that was totally chaotic when you leave like the partner and the kids and the bills and the job and the everything and you remove yourself from that environment may you get popped back into it it's like the people around you assume that great you're finally home because now you can take care of the kids and pick up the you know dry cleaning and you know it's they expect you to be there the way you were and so much more and it's completely unrealistic and you know that they're not willing to change their behaviors if they're still going to be able to drink or have pills or whatever it is and it's it's not okay it's not safe and so that it's a difficult thing,is there a strategy that you use that that that you have found to be successful in your experience with maybe that the problem cases are the harder cases
429,is there a strategy that you use that that that you have found to be successful in your experience with maybe that the problem cases are the harder cases,I think that's a common like idea is that oh the ones that have been through treatment a bunch are more difficult or those who have you know just been unsuccessful and they've tried or they've grown up in this environment or that environment and you know it's everyone is different that's why I I personally have a very eclectic approach to each individual and I work with a fantastic team that I can run things by you know people who have stronger knowledge base on certain things so I think everyone has to be approached individually
430,I think that's a common like idea is that oh the ones that have been through treatment a bunch are more difficult or those who have you know just been unsuccessful and they've tried or they've grown up in this environment or that environment and you know it's everyone is different that's why I I personally have a very eclectic approach to each individual and I work with a fantastic team that I can run things by you know people who have stronger knowledge base on certain things so I think everyone has to be approached individually,so I guess the message here is that the transition is really important yes the treatment facility is good you could need to go to the detoxification the group therapy but it's also that transition period in every facility I think has a an intensive outpatient program or a sober living environment or at least the referrals that you can get to that so it doesn't just stop after the 28 days it continues and that's I think what we're saying professionally here well actually leads us to the last our last show we we met with the girl named sunny and we're gonna do a flashback here but sunny was basically offered treatment and she she's knows so much about herself she's very good at saying exactly what she feels and she you could just see there was no hope there she basically said look I've been through these programs I helped run these programs I was a counselor and I was going into the bathroom and I was shooting up in the bathroom and I was going out and no one even knew it for weeks and weeks and weeks and so then at this point she's like well I'll try it but why bother at this point I'd been through it all I know myself and we've all been there where we knew ourselves we knew that nothing was going to stand the way of our using we wanted to stop but our head just check something happened in our brains and something happened with with our lives that all of a sudden we would go back to using again and she knew herself but is it always is anyone a lost cause that's it always worth it
431,so I guess the message here is that the transition is really important yes the treatment facility is good you could need to go to the detoxification the group therapy but it's also that transition period in every facility I think has a an intensive outpatient program or a sober living environment or at least the referrals that you can get to that so it doesn't just stop after the 28 days it continues and that's I think what we're saying professionally here well actually leads us to the last our last show we we met with the girl named sunny and we're gonna do a flashback here but sunny was basically offered treatment and she she's knows so much about herself she's very good at saying exactly what she feels and she you could just see there was no hope there she basically said look I've been through these programs I helped run these programs I was a counselor and I was going into the bathroom and I was shooting up in the bathroom and I was going out and no one even knew it for weeks and weeks and weeks and so then at this point she's like well I'll try it but why bother at this point I'd been through it all I know myself and we've all been there where we knew ourselves we knew that nothing was going to stand the way of our using we wanted to stop but our head just check something happened in our brains and something happened with with our lives that all of a sudden we would go back to using again and she knew herself but is it always is anyone a lost cause that's it always worth it,absolutely
432,absolutely,my wife Sonny had a period of sobriety and she relapse back in May we have a small child we have two and a half year old son

449,but you've worked hard it hasn't been easy,no it hasn't I've had some struggles like just mental struggles you know when you get back into mode to a relapse it's like or feel that feeling and then you know if to just pray on it and just like so something else can intervene and like besides yourself you know because i did and God stepped in and took those things away you know like because once you're in that mode it's very hard to once you're locked in a mode that you decided to use or like that you're getting feeling like you may want to it's very hard to get yourself out of that and I managed to pull myself out of that with the help of Spencer

Steele last week because of increasing stress and anxiety that's kind of getting the best of me and in the course of my appointment with him he was asking how I was dealing with that stress and I mentioned that my one or two glasses of wine a few nights a week is turning into more frequent in maybe three or four on some nights and he had some concerns about that and and felt like maybe you could help me with stress or something
453,well I came to see dr. Steele last week because of increasing stress and anxiety that's kind of getting the best of me and in the course of my appointment with him he was asking how I was dealing with that stress and I mentioned that my one or two glasses of wine a few nights a week is turning into more frequent in maybe three or four on some nights and he had some concerns about that and and felt like maybe you could help me with stress or something,yeah so he he actually see me because he went to him for increased stress and he's concerned that your alcohol consumption may be a part of that increase and prior to prescribing you anything you want to make sure that you had someone to talk to about that
454,yeah so he he actually see me because he went to him for increased stress and he's concerned that your alcohol consumption may be a part of that increase and prior to prescribing you anything you want to make sure that you had someone to talk to about that,I suppose
455,I suppose,okay I saw you filled in one of the pink sheets might take a little bit
456,okay I saw you filled in one of the pink sheets might take a little bit,he told me to fill that out and bring it with me
457,he told me to fill that out and bring it with me,okay thank you so you say here that you have four or more drinks in one week you mentioned that you may be increasing that a little bit as well um and that you have one or two drinks in one setting
458,okay thank you so you say here that you have four or more drinks in one week you mentioned that you may be increasing that a little bit as well um and that you have one or two drinks in one setting,typically
459,typically,yeah and maybe monthly you have more than that what what's what kind of drinks do you have what do you drink we need to drive
460,yeah and maybe monthly you have more than that what what's what kind of drinks do you have what do you drink we need to drive,wine with my meals um you know again one or two typically and more frequently three or four so my stress is increased
461,wine with my meals um you know again one or two typically and more frequently three or four so my stress is increased,so starting to increase this times drink a little more okay well based on what you put here you give it gives you six points on this scale scale ranges from zero to forty so six points will put you in what we consider an at-risk zone so if it's okay with you lots to talk a bit about that
462,so starting to increase this times drink a little more okay well based on what you put here you give it gives you six points on this scale scale ranges from zero to forty so six points will put you in what we consider an at-risk zone so if it's okay with you lots to talk a bit about that,okay
463,okay,okay so that was sunset run zero to forty it's not it's not a super high risk but it certainly could be a risk for maybe increasing stress maybe some physical Emmas related to alcohol well could start to show up if you were to increase your drinking from there or you can stay there this is a typical standard drink size over here I'm not sure whether that fits your description of a glass of wine a lot
464,okay so that was sunset run zero to forty it's not it's not a super high risk but it certainly could be a risk for maybe increasing stress maybe some physical Emmas related to alcohol well could start to show up if you were to increase your drinking from there or you can stay there this is a typical standard drink size over here I'm not sure whether that fits your description of a glass of wine a lot,I fill the glass up so maybe a little more than
465,I fill the glass up so maybe a little more than,yeah maybe the little space that it's upside to drink drink and a half each one so that also increased a little bit more so perhaps maybe drinking more than you indicated on here and for women you healthy woman your age no more than three drinks in one setting is considered to be lower or no-risk and 1/7 in one week
466,yeah maybe the little space that it's upside to drink drink and a half each one so that also increased a little bit more so perhaps maybe drinking more than you indicated on here and for women you healthy woman your age no more than three drinks in one setting is considered to be lower or no-risk and 1/7 in one week,so in total
467,so in total,how much total in the week and what you say here is that even on this sheet you're perhaps already drinking more than that
468,how much total in the week and what you say here is that even on this sheet you're perhaps already drinking more than that,mmm
469,mmm,so what do you make of all that
470,so what do you make of all that,well that news to me you know I thought red wine with your meals is supposed to be healthy and you know no more than seven in a week that seems kind of prohibitive
471,well that news to me you know I thought red wine with your meals is supposed to be healthy and you know no more than seven in a week that seems kind of prohibitive,yeah it seems it seems a little less than perhaps you've been drinking with what you consider to be healthy drinking and certainly there's this conflicting information out there about what's healthy what's not healthy imagine the increased stresses what because we're concerned or to seal as your stresses increases and if you were to prescribe you anything maybe some interaction between the two but also build and serve them I would think so if you would what is it that you like about alcohol
472,yeah it seems it seems a little less than perhaps you've been drinking with what you consider to be healthy drinking and certainly there's this conflicting information out there about what's healthy what's not healthy imagine the increased stresses what because we're concerned or to seal as your stresses increases and if you were to prescribe you anything maybe some interaction between the two but also build and serve them I would think so if you would what is it that you like about alcohol,well you know it does at least in the moment temporarily reduce my stress and I you know like a good glass of wine I don't don't drink the cheap stuff I like the expensive what
473,so you like the taste of it mm-hmm and it does help to lower the stress signal which is for that time you're drinking one of those so good things about alcohol for you,um well you know the nights that maybe I have a couple more glasses than I should I wake up feeling kind of yuck and of course part of my stress is finances and I mentioned I like the good stuff and so if I'm drinking more than I'm increasing my financial burden
474,yeah so your financial stress may be increased by the fact that you're drinking,yeah kind of defeating the purpose there
475,yeah kind of defeating the purpose there,22 the drinking to do stress and increasing stresses so the one hand it lowers it on the other hand it's increasing kind of a seesaw teeter-totter effect then what do you make of that give them that on one hand it lowers and the other had it increases and now it's increasing even more
476,22 the drinking to do stress and increasing stresses so the one hand it lowers it on the other hand it's increasing kind of a seesaw teeter-totter effect then what do you make of that give them that on one hand it lowers and the other had it increases and now it's increasing even more,maybe I need to find some other way to deal with my stress
477,maybe I need to find some other way to deal with my stress,yeah imagine you've had some thoughts of that what have you thought of trying
478,yeah imagine you've had some thoughts of that what have you thought of trying,well I've exercised in the past and that helps right now my schedule is kind of out of whack and I just really don't know what to do that's why I came to see dr. Steele I thought maybe he can prescribe me something that would help me you know when I'm feeling overwhelmed
479,well I've exercised in the past and that helps right now my schedule is kind of out of whack and I just really don't know what to do that's why I came to see dr. Steele I thought maybe he can prescribe me something that would help me you know when I'm feeling overwhelmed,and he may be able to I'm not saying that he cannot I'm just imagine that he's concerned that if you continue to drink on the level that you are drinking that whatever he prescribes you there may be an interaction with the to imagine that she's concerned I'm not completely sure so you've had some success in the past with changing behaviors and if you were to decide to make any changes here it sounds like you could drop all that to make those changes how important would it be for you on a scale of 0 through 10 i below the visual here with that if zero is not important tennis is very important to do something about your drinking way
480,and he may be able to I'm not saying that he cannot I'm just imagine that he's concerned that if you continue to drink on the level that you are drinking that whatever he prescribes you there may be an interaction with the to imagine that she's concerned I'm not completely sure so you've had some success in the past with changing behaviors and if you were to decide to make any changes here it sounds like you could drop all that to make those changes how important would it be for you on a scale of 0 through 10 i below the visual here with that if zero is not important tennis is very important to do something about your drinking way,mm-hmm well I mean if if it means that it's increasing my stress and or he's not going to prescribe me anything because of my drinking then it's fairly important maybe about a 7
481,mm-hmm well I mean if if it means that it's increasing my stress and or he's not going to prescribe me anything because of my drinking then it's fairly important maybe about a 7,mm-hmm let's put it up there why do you choose a 7 or a 504
482,mm-hmm let's put it up there why do you choose a 7 or a 504,well again I've got to get things under control you know my kids are depending on me and I've got to go to work to help ease this financial stress and so you know all those responsibilities
483,well again I've got to get things under control you know my kids are depending on me and I've got to go to work to help ease this financial stress and so you know all those responsibilities,there's a lot riding on your decision in what to do this what if anything will bring up too late online on that scale
484,there's a lot riding on your decision in what to do this what if anything will bring up too late online on that scale,um well the you know the risk that you mentioned about the drug interaction I certainly can't afford to you know have any more stress
485,um well the you know the risk that you mentioned about the drug interaction I certainly can't afford to you know have any more stress,yeah so so you choose to lower your stress rather than increase it and if lo and your drinking would have that effect that something be willing to do right now how confident are you that you could do something about your drinking
486,yeah so so you choose to lower your stress rather than increase it and if lo and your drinking would have that effect that something be willing to do right now how confident are you that you could do something about your drinking,I'm pretty confident and you know probably about a seven or eight
487,I'm pretty confident and you know probably about a seven or eight,okay so it's pretty hot up there again and what if what if anything would you choose to do would be to cut down with a bit to quit just in case but
488,okay so it's pretty hot up there again and what if what if anything would you choose to do would be to cut down with a bit to quit just in case but,you know I like I said like a good glass of wine I don't want to quit altogether I'd be willing to try cutting that but you know if it's going to if doctor seal would agree to prescribe me something for the anxiety and it meant that I had to not drink at all I'd be willing to do that at least for a period of time
489,you know I like I said like a good glass of wine I don't want to quit altogether I'd be willing to try cutting that but you know if it's going to if doctor seal would agree to prescribe me something for the anxiety and it meant that I had to not drink at all I'd be willing to do that at least for a period of time,so you'd be willing to stop altogether that's what was indicated by the physician okay so so based on that how ready are you to do anything right now whether it's to cut back whether it is to quit
490,so you'd be willing to stop altogether that's what was indicated by the physician okay so so based on that how ready are you to do anything right now whether it's to cut back whether it is to quit,well again you know if I can get something to help me manage if maybe I can find some other way to deal with the stress then then you know I be pretty ready I again maybe about in on that scale maybe an eighth
491,well again you know if I can get something to help me manage if maybe I can find some other way to deal with the stress then then you know I be pretty ready I again maybe about in on that scale maybe an eighth,okay so that's that's pretty hot there as well it sounds is that you'll be pretty motivated to do something about this right now given your responsibilities given your children relying at this point and just on on lowering anxiety in general it sounds and that's one of your goals as well well I'm pretty confident that once you decide to do whatever it is you decide to do you'll be able to follow through that based on your experience in the past of of making behavior changes imagine some things that you can draw upon what's one thing that you could do imagine you thought of some things might help to lower your stress
492,okay so that's that's pretty hot there as well it sounds is that you'll be pretty motivated to do something about this right now given your responsibilities given your children relying at this point and just on on lowering anxiety in general it sounds and that's one of your goals as well well I'm pretty confident that once you decide to do whatever it is you decide to do you'll be able to follow through that based on your experience in the past of of making behavior changes imagine some things that you can draw upon what's one thing that you could do imagine you thought of some things might help to lower your stress,well I you know the the exercise but again that's that's kind of difficult to fit in right now hoping that dr. seal will prescribe something for me to take when I'm feeling particularly overwhelmed and maybe just having somebody to talk to to bounce some things off of
493,well I you know the the exercise but again that's that's kind of difficult to fit in right now hoping that dr. seal will prescribe something for me to take when I'm feeling particularly overwhelmed and maybe just having somebody to talk to to bounce some things off of,one of the things we can't offer here is for you to come in and talk to one of our behavioral health specialists may be able to help you talk talk through this there's a terrible stress and sound like responsibility there and we can make a point for you if you like before you leave today dad talk to someone
494,one of the things we can't offer here is for you to come in and talk to one of our behavioral health specialists may be able to help you talk talk through this there's a terrible stress and sound like responsibility there and we can make a point for you if you like before you leave today dad talk to someone,that'd be nice
495,that'd be nice,right it also has some information here if you're interested some a pamphlet on alcohol and and how what healthy limits are and how it may be affected by medications that you took as well and I wish you lots of luck it sounds as though you really committed to making this shift in this change and imagined doctors still wanna fight with you and see how you do with your with your change within a few weeks again I look forward to speaking to in the future
496,right it also has some information here if you're interested some a pamphlet on alcohol and and how what healthy limits are and how it may be affected by medications that you took as well and I wish you lots of luck it sounds as though you really committed to making this shift in this change and imagined doctors still wanna fight with you and see how you do with your with your change within a few weeks again I look forward to speaking to in the future,all right thank you very much
497,all right thank you very much,you're welcome
498,you're welcome,so Chris they wanted to talk to you you know you're one of our starter athletes of really value you as a team player as athletic director one of my job's is to kind of keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best and something came up this weekend I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and I understand you were there and so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now
499,so Chris they wanted to talk to you you know you're one of our starter athletes of really value you as a team player as athletic director one of my job's is to kind of keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best and something came up this weekend I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and I understand you were there and so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now,okay Oh actually could I confide something in you that has been bothering me lately well prior to that party like as you know I'm an honor student and my parents did keep me very like kept down out of the lake so like social life and about a month ago my friends they invited me into a party and I used the fact that all I'm always doing my homework and always studying that to allow me to go to the party and um well that party I managed to convince my parents that I would spend the night at my friend's house so I that's when I started drinking it was a unique experience as you could say I guess you can say and I don't know I was fun at least in the moment so I kept doing it then this past weekend instead of studying for an exam I asked my I begged my mom to let me go to another party and she kind of knew what I was doing she asked me to like to promise her no alcohol no drugs man I'll pick you up by 12 and I was surprised twelve was told us basically when the party starts but I told her whatever I thought I thought to myself that I'll come home figure out to delay her call me pick me up later so later so she I promise she dropped me off I promised her no alcohol no nothing so we go I have fun like I've been having and I was drinking and then it's time the time came for her to pick me up and as soon I couldn't delay her for pick me up and as soon as she picked me up and I step in the car she said you drank vodka and I'm like I I didn't know what to say I just looked at the floor and I feel terrible because I I betrayed my mother I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol and that's exactly what I did
500,so here you are you're an honor student you're star athlete you've kind of been doing everything you've been told for all these years and maybe last month sometime you started getting more involved in the party scene and it was fun at first but now you're already noticing some consequence,right like I've been noticing I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork I haven't really I kind of just sit in class like my mind is elsewhere especially on the weekends we're instead about instead of studying I'm caught up with my friends trying to find what we can I get alcohol based on their age and stuff like that
501,it's really changed your focus yeah what do you like about drinking,I don't know it it's I'm a very reserved person for the most part not well not when I'm doing sports but like you know like a social environment I tend to keep to myself because I'm very self-conscious I would say and when I when I drink I feel I don't know like it relaxes me I'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily
502,so helps you kind of used to not feel more relaxed,exactly
503,exactly,sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though mom got mad at you you're having decreased focus you're kind of not doing so well in school maybe
504,sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though mom got mad at you you're having decreased focus you're kind of not doing so well in school maybe,China
505,China,any other things
506,any other things,just different group of friends of group of girlfriends thank you different people that I'm hanging out with because certain people are associated with that type of so that's that that's also changed
507,so your your friends that you were hanging out with there's a little tension there now,a little bit because not all of them are into that so like I'm in one group of friends and I would talk to another person there's another group of friends and they just happened to invite me to that first party so since then I've been hanging out more with them getting to know them but I could also see that oh I'm just living life I guess but that's also not fair to them that I'm not there for them as much as it was before
508,a little bit because not all of them are into that so like I'm in one group of friends and I would talk to another person there's another group of friends and they just happened to invite me to that first party so since then I've been hanging out more with them getting to know them but I could also see that oh I'm just living life I guess but that's also not fair to them that I'm not there for them as much as it was before,okay
509,okay,as they are there for me
510,as they are there for me,well given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships it's affecting your studying it's affecting your relationship with your mom where do you think you should to kind of go from here
511,well given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships it's affecting your studying it's affecting your relationship with your mom where do you think you should to kind of go from here,oh I feel I should just stop I mean like I'm not not unrealistic I understand that situations like this will happen
512,oh I feel I should just stop I mean like I'm not not unrealistic I understand that situations like this will happen,mm-hmm
513,mm-hmm,it's just up to me not to take it so far where I can't remember the night before or if I'm puking all I remember is the toilet that's that's not worth it either and I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that's a big blow it's little I guess it may seem to other people like created it it's a big thing
514,it's just up to me not to take it so far where I can't remember the night before or if I'm puking all I remember is the toilet that's that's not worth it either and I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that's a big blow it's little I guess it may seem to other people like created it it's a big thing,your mom is really important to you
515,your mom is really important to you,of course
516,of course,and how she feels about you is important
517,and how she feels about you is important,exactly
518,exactly,how important is it to you to make an adjustment in your drinking or even to quit
519,how important is it to you to make an adjustment in your drinking or even to quit,a lot at this point because I feel that's a big factor with gaining back my trust with my mother and also getting back on top of my schoolwork again my athletics - okay I feel that there's a feature in that
520,a lot at this point because I feel that's a big factor with gaining back my trust with my mother and also getting back on top of my schoolwork again my athletics - okay I feel that there's a feature in that,how confident are you that you could actually change or you're drinking or even cut down or quit
521,how confident are you that you could actually change or you're drinking or even cut down or quit,I'm pretty confident especially
522,I'm pretty confident especially,on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all antennas completely when
523,on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all antennas completely when,I'm probably like an eighth of nine I mean I can't be a ten just nothing's a 10 in life I feel like there's too many factors but I feel like I'm determined
524,I'm probably like an eighth of nine I mean I can't be a ten just nothing's a 10 in life I feel like there's too many factors but I feel like I'm determined,- why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than 6 or 7
525,- why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than 6 or 7,because I don't know I feel - turn to determine - to make sure this happens because I don't like how I felt after I betrayed my mother I don't like remembering that the feeling of like vomiting it's not a pleasant experience it-it's not something that I wish to enjoy so even if I do drink I don't want to drink to the point where that happens like all the fun that I have then prior to that it's not worth it's not worth drinking
526,because I don't know I feel - turn to determine - to make sure this happens because I don't like how I felt after I betrayed my mother I don't like remembering that the feeling of like vomiting it's not a pleasant experience it-it's not something that I wish to enjoy so even if I do drink I don't want to drink to the point where that happens like all the fun that I have then prior to that it's not worth it's not worth drinking,all right what do you think's a realistic goal for you then
527,all right what do you think's a realistic goal for you then,to make sure I have my studies well first try to get get back my trust with my mother then just focus on my studies then if I have time I need your time like oh I'll go party with my friends and just be as I party with them doesn't mean I have to drink and I do one cup is not gonna do anything to my life either but I'd prefer not to do that I prefer just make sure
528,to make sure I have my studies well first try to get get back my trust with my mother then just focus on my studies then if I have time I need your time like oh I'll go party with my friends and just be as I party with them doesn't mean I have to drink and I do one cup is not gonna do anything to my life either but I'd prefer not to do that I prefer just make sure,your goal is kind of to not drink at all or if you are at a party a maximum of one at the very most
529,your goal is kind of to not drink at all or if you are at a party a maximum of one at the very most,exactly just so I take part with the social convention but it's not hey guys drop doing though

589,yeah um I got a DUI for being under the influence of alcohol marijuana,alcohol marijuana how recently was this DUI
590,alcohol marijuana how recently was this DUI,Um about a week ago
591,Um about a week ago,okay so what's been going on what is gonna happen
592,okay so what's been going on what is gonna happen,um well I am gonna have to go to court soon and I know that I'm probably gonna have to get some type of like treatment or something like that but I really just don't want to so I just I'm just coming here because I don't know maybe I can like get out of it if I'm getting some type of treatment but I don't know
593,um well I am gonna have to go to court soon and I know that I'm probably gonna have to get some type of like treatment or something like that but I really just don't want to so I just I'm just coming here because I don't know maybe I can like get out of it if I'm getting some type of treatment but I don't know,get out of it you mean gonna have the charge
594,get out of it you mean gonna have the charge,yeah I mean I feel like they're probably gonna make me like go to rehab or something like that I want to do that
595,so you feel like you can get out of the rehab part too-,um I don't know I really am Not sure I just know that I don't know getting in getting the DUI is kind of just made me realize I like me to make it change but I'm just not ready to stop drinking or using marijuana there's just like the only things that like really help me in my life
596,all right so with this recent arrest you realize it may be about you to stop using but really don't want to,mm-hmm yeah
597,mm-hmm yeah,so you're stuck there
598,so you're stuck there,yeah it kind of like I would like realized that like drinking and using marijuana hasn't like got me anywhere positive really but it's like the only thing that like I know I just that's all I do usually and it's all in that mix we ever like feel better
599,yeah it kind of like I would like realized that like drinking and using marijuana hasn't like got me anywhere positive really but it's like the only thing that like I know I just that's all I do usually and it's all in that mix we ever like feel better,when you drink do you ever socialize at the same time
600,when you drink do you ever socialize at the same time,I mean sometimes I'll like go to bars and things like that but most of the times just like that I am at my house
601,I mean sometimes I'll like go to bars and things like that but most of the times just like that I am at my house,alone safety of the marijuana
602,alone safety of the marijuana,yeah I mean I'd like a few people that always smoke with but usually just kinda by myself I mean I smoke every day so thought it was with people I'm doing it
603,so doesn't sound like you're really worried about losing your social support if you stop using,no not really
604,no not really,what are you losing
605,what are you losing,I kind of just like use it to like cope I got like I have a brain injury that I got like a while ago like it still causes pain and that's just the only thing that ever seemed to help once after the injury
606,this is the alcohol in there one,mm-hmm
607,mm-hmm,so you take it for pain relief equalities
608,so you take it for pain relief equalities,yeah
609,yeah,any other reasons
610,any other reasons,um it's just easier it's just the marijuana like relaxes me it's just easier to kind of like forget about things when I'm using
611,like forget about problems,yeah
612,yeah,so it affects your mood in a positive way
613,so it affects your mood in a positive way,yeah like I get like I'd like the feeling once I'm drunk and then if I'm feeling like anxious or anything like that like the marijuana helps with that so then just it's easier to like I don't feel anything so I don't have to worry I don't have to deal with any negative feelings
614,yeah like I get like I'd like the feeling once I'm drunk and then if I'm feeling like anxious or anything like that like the marijuana helps with that so then just it's easier to like I don't feel anything so I don't have to worry I don't have to deal with any negative feelings,have you used since you had the DUI
615,have you used since you had the DUI,um I haven't drank but I've smoked like I've cut back on my smoking a little bit but I'm still using
616,um I haven't drank but I've smoked like I've cut back on my smoking a little bit but I'm still using,alright it's been a bit of a situation all right so you have the use takes away pain for you it takes away anxiety feels good but then you have these consequences of the law
617,alright it's been a bit of a situation all right so you have the use takes away pain for you it takes away anxiety feels good but then you have these consequences of the law,yeah
618,yeah,how do you figure those two things out
619,how do you figure those two things out,I don't know I don't know if there's a way to figure both of my I just know like not I just couldn't imagine not drinking you not using marijuana he had imagined it
620,I don't know I don't know if there's a way to figure both of my I just know like not I just couldn't imagine not drinking you not using marijuana he had imagined it,all right so you can't imagine that so was it at the other side can you imagine having further incensed with law enforcement more charges in the future
621,all right so you can't imagine that so was it at the other side can you imagine having further incensed with law enforcement more charges in the future,um I guess I hadn't really considered that I mean that I don't want there today I guess I would want this to kind of like go as smoothly as possible not get any more charges or anything like that not be in this situation again
622,so you could kind of picture an outcome where you beat these charges or there's not I really have a consequence and you'll be more careful in the future,Um I don't know yeah I guess so I guess I probably just wouldn't drive if I like was just turning like right before try to like avoid that situation again
623,so with that thinking you could continue to use as you were that you would take out the part that got you in trouble,yeah
624,yeah,the first you have to get out of trouble this time
625,the first you have to get out of trouble this time,yep
626,yep,so if you could have the pain and anxiety go away without the alcohol marijuana would you continue to use it
627,so if you could have the pain and anxiety go away without the alcohol marijuana would you continue to use it,I just couldn't imagine getting to a place where that wasn't what was like helping me and then to like I don't I drink mostly by myself but I couldn't imagine like if my friends called me up and said hey do you want to go out tonight like not drinking with them
628,so there is a social component here,yeah a little bit I drink mainly by myself just because all my friends work like 95 jobs they don't drink every day but I do but like on the weekends and things like all of my friends who I do have they all do drink all right
629,yeah a little bit I drink mainly by myself just because all my friends work like 95 jobs they don't drink every day but I do but like on the weekends and things like all of my friends who I do have they all do drink all right,so you know if you had no anxiety no pain you'd have to give up at least those interactions with your friends how would they respond if you went out with them and didn't drink
630,so you know if you had no anxiety no pain you'd have to give up at least those interactions with your friends how would they respond if you went out with them and didn't drink,um they probably just like wouldn't understand it because we all go out when we got like really drunken I would just feel like out of place
631,so it'd be socially awkward,yeah
632,yeah,straining the relationships with your friends
633,straining the relationships with your friends,mm-hmm
634,mm-hmm,so the quitting and alcohol and marijuana like stopping use that doesn't seem like a good route for you
635,so the quitting and alcohol and marijuana like stopping use that doesn't seem like a good route for you,No not at all
636,No not at all,but then you have this this recent situation which is making you second-guess some of it
637,but then you have this this recent situation which is making you second-guess some of it,yeah I mean it's making me think that like maybe I I need to like make a change I just can't see that that's the change I'm making
638,so you need to make some change,yeah
639,yeah,but not the alcohol and drugs
640,but not the alcohol and drugs,yeah
641,yeah,something else could change
642,something else could change,yeah I don't know what
643,yeah I don't know what,you have any theories
644,you have any theories,I mean I just thinking like just like cutting back on it and like not drinking and driving obviously because that's what like got me into this situation don't like other than that really and I really have really thought of what I could do
645,so you could reduce your usage avoid driving and that might that might get you to your goal would that be enough usage to stop the anxiety in the pain,I don't know it might just not go anywhere ever right not sure drive is often
646,I don't know it might just not go anywhere ever right not sure drive is often,mmm
647,mmm,because I don't know if I would if I'd be able to cut back drinking enough to like not have to like feel okay
648,because I don't know if I would if I'd be able to cut back drinking enough to like not have to like feel okay,hmm so that strategy might not work
649,hmm so that strategy might not work,I guess not
650,I guess not,that's something you've been tossing around though this idea of isolating a little bit more and drinking a little less seems like all your options here kind of grim
651,that's something you've been tossing around though this idea of isolating a little bit more and drinking a little less seems like all your options here kind of grim,yeah
652,yeah,is that just is that just me or does it seem that way to you to
653,is that just is that just me or does it seem that way to you to,now that I'm like talking through it yeah and I don't think I have any choice really
654,you don't have any choice what's gonna happen it's going to happen,I don't know
655,I don't know,all right so let's start with early know or pick up with what we know you don't want to make a bad impression in this whole court proceeding with the DUI what do you think you could do that would make a bad person
656,all right so let's start with early know or pick up with what we know you don't want to make a bad impression in this whole court proceeding with the DUI what do you think you could do that would make a bad person,Um go to court wrong test positive if I get drug tested
657,Um go to court wrong test positive if I get drug tested,That would do it
658,That would do it,I would do it get another DUI in the meantime
659,I would do it get another DUI in the meantime,that wouldn't look good either all right so you want to avoid those behaviors for sure so you know for sure you don't want it those things would it be acceptable to do those things
660,that wouldn't look good either all right so you want to avoid those behaviors for sure so you know for sure you don't want it those things would it be acceptable to do those things,I mean not really I mean I think I could avoid the nollie drunk-driving enough or maybe not to drank the day of my court date but I don't know about the whole you marijuana part
661,that's tougher,yeah
662,yeah,all right so would you appreciate those as goals like avoiding those situations like going in the court drunk
663,all right so would you appreciate those as goals like avoiding those situations like going in the court drunk,yeah
664,yeah,goals that you could get behind
665,goals that you could get behind,um I mean I can try I guess so like think about it and try to get out there I know I'm gonna be stressed out the day of my court dates are it's gonna be hard to like not drink that day
666,you're not striking me as overly enthusiastic about this idea,No I am not
667,No I am not,this is really tough for you the alcohol
668,this is really tough for you the alcohol,um
669,um,the marijuana that are important to you
670,the marijuana that are important to you,yeah
671,yeah,this whole DUI thing  it's really just encroached on something you had going on that you enjoyed
672,this whole DUI thing  it's really just encroached on something you had going on that you enjoyed,yeah
673,yeah,so is this an inconvenience that you can move past or is this a major life event that does change things
674,so is this an inconvenience that you can move past or is this a major life event that does change things,Um I don't know because I don't know any other like way around it than just dealing with it I mean if I like don't go to court or anything that's gonna warrant out for me like I can't I can't avoid this situation
675,Um I don't know because I don't know any other like way around it than just dealing with it I mean if I like don't go to court or anything that's gonna warrant out for me like I can't I can't avoid this situation,what if as a condition of your treatment the judge says no more drinking in no more marijuana period legacy to that you obey those rules or or jail
676,what if as a condition of your treatment the judge says no more drinking in no more marijuana period legacy to that you obey those rules or or jail,I don't know if it would I get to that I know it possibly could that probably will but I I don't know
677,I don't know if it would I get to that I know it possibly could that probably will but I I don't know,I would think it almost certainly would have
678,I would think it almost certainly would have,yeah I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't imagine like not drinking and using drugs I'm sure I would like leave court that day thinking I would but I don't know what happened when I get home for the next day or that day
679,yeah I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't imagine like not drinking and using drugs I'm sure I would like leave court that day thinking I would but I don't know what happened when I get home for the next day or that day,let's go back a couple of steps how long have you been using the alcohol marijuana
680,let's go back a couple of steps how long have you been using the alcohol marijuana,for about like six years
681,for about like six years,six years
682,six years,have you ever until now with the DUI have you ever envisioned stopping
683,have you ever until now with the DUI have you ever envisioned stopping,no
684,no,what's your plan like what pre DUI well is your plan in all this
685,what's your plan like what pre DUI well is your plan in all this,I just I did like the jerking kind of has gotten worse it wasn't always that bad I've always used marijuana but the alcohol is I guess I've been using a little bit more recently so I didn't really ever have a plan the marijuana never really looked affected my life too much but I guess the alcohol has been a little bit more
686,I just I did like the jerking kind of has gotten worse it wasn't always that bad I've always used marijuana but the alcohol is I guess I've been using a little bit more recently so I didn't really ever have a plan the marijuana never really looked affected my life too much but I guess the alcohol has been a little bit more,yeah so without this or something you would have continued using yeah for years to come
687,yeah so without this or something you would have continued using yeah for years to come,yeah I didn't really have any like I never like thought I want to stop doing this or anything like that or had a reason to or
688,yeah I didn't really have any like I never like thought I want to stop doing this or anything like that or had a reason to or,till now
689,till now,yeah
690,yeah,could this be in a strange way like an opportunity
691,could this be in a strange way like an opportunity,I mean I guess if I had if I wanted to stop this would be a way for me to stop or a reason for me to stop
692,I mean I guess if I had if I wanted to stop this would be a way for me to stop or a reason for me to stop,if you really wanted to stop could you stop
693,if you really wanted to stop could you stop,I don't know may I guess I could try but I don't have that one
694,I don't know may I guess I could try but I don't have that one,you could give it a shot you're just not sure you could you could actually do it
695,you could give it a shot you're just not sure you could you could actually do it,yeah I mean I've never tried to before so I don't know
696,yeah I mean I've never tried to before so I don't know,it's just unknown

699,so where do you want to go from here you have this DUI I imagine a hearing or some type coming up right here to see me what can I do to help you,um I guess yes help me figure out whether or not like I do want to stop drinking or using drugs I mean that might be something that I have to do right now I don't really want to so I don't know if I could like get to a place where I actually do want to stop it'd be easier to actually do it then
700,um I guess yes help me figure out whether or not like I do want to stop drinking or using drugs I mean that might be something that I have to do right now I don't really want to so I don't know if I could like get to a place where I actually do want to stop it'd be easier to actually do it then,like a like a place in terms of your thinking like your mentality

865,mm-hmm,and then in terms of respect I I kind of view that as one of like my major like rules like I I really do think respect is important to respect myself or respect those around me so
866,and then in terms of respect I I kind of view that as one of like my major like rules like I I really do think respect is important to respect myself or respect those around me so,okay
867,okay,I place great importance in that
868,okay great so sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of belonging like you said a sense of purpose anyway and then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing it's not just Authority but respecting yourself respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you okay that's great all right well one of the things I want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends so what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends,um sometimes if you just you know go to the movies go to the beach like I had said or sometimes we just get together someone's house play some board games and hang out
869,um sometimes if you just you know go to the movies go to the beach like I had said or sometimes we just get together someone's house play some board games and hang out,mm-hmm and when you're hanging out with friends is there ever alcohol involved
870,mm-hmm and when you're hanging out with friends is there ever alcohol involved,yeah sometimes
871,yeah sometimes,okay can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene
872,okay can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene,uh well it's mostly just for for parties or party settings it's kind of to get things going and got everything loosened up as they say
873,uh well it's mostly just for for parties or party settings it's kind of to get things going and got everything loosened up as they say,mm-hmm and so when you go to parties most of the time there's alcohol there okay and how often do you think you would say you're drinking
874,mm-hmm and so when you go to parties most of the time there's alcohol there okay and how often do you think you would say you're drinking,I'd say um on a not busy month for instance I'd say about like two weekends out of the month two three
875,mm-hmm so about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink,the days that we drink are mostly like I said they're parties so it's more of that whole partying and dancing and you know having everyone have fun and then when we don't it's a lot more relaxed it's a lot more hanging out playing board games watching a movie it's not yeah
876,so it really depends on what the activity is whether or not alcohols get,definitely
877,definitely,okay and do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus and that you're playing board games
878,okay and do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus and that you're playing board games,I think of them as as different I think you know like in playing board games and things it's meant to be relaxing so it's nice to have like that kind of breather versus with a party it's a lot more energetic it's a after at all it's very draining
879,I think of them as as different I think you know like in playing board games and things it's meant to be relaxing so it's nice to have like that kind of breather versus with a party it's a lot more energetic it's a after at all it's very draining,mm-hmm
880,mm-hmm,but in the moment it's quite fun to dance and have
881,okay so there's sort of pros and cons,oh yeah
882,oh yeah,okay what are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol
883,okay what are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol,um it's you know when we drink we we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not you know everyone's drinking together we're a lot more loosened up and relaxed and not really thinking about stresses or things like that but it can be when it's too much drinking it can be can be obviously bad
884,um it's you know when we drink we we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not you know everyone's drinking together we're a lot more loosened up and relaxed and not really thinking about stresses or things like that but it can be when it's too much drinking it can be can be obviously bad,okay so sort of in the the too much drinking or our times can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol
885,okay so sort of in the the too much drinking or our times can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol,um a lot of times it will make make people stupid yeah you know people make dumb decisions and things like that we we usually try to be as safe about it as possible so like sleepover friends house and so you know we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group so we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks but um definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're stupid when they're drunk can can be really stupid
886,hmm so you're trying to like you said not engage in really dangerous activities you're trying to stay put you're not driving you're trying to stay with people that you trust but yet it sounds like there's still some some things happening,sometimes yeah
887,sometimes yeah,can you tell me a little bit about that
888,can you tell me a little bit about that,well I especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends like we drink too much and we hadn't up like throwing up and things like that that I don't that's not fun
889,well I especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends like we drink too much and we hadn't up like throwing up and things like that that I don't that's not fun,yeah throwing up is never fun it's not and how often do you think that happened
890,yeah throwing up is never fun it's not and how often do you think that happened,for me that's happened to me once it was the first time I ever drank and it was it was a lot and you know what I was doing I was mixing all kinds of weird things I'm just kind of taking anything ever anyone gave me and that didn't end well but after that I have it but I do have friends that that still do sometimes so I'll end up like having to take care of them or something and
891,for me that's happened to me once it was the first time I ever drank and it was it was a lot and you know what I was doing I was mixing all kinds of weird things I'm just kind of taking anything ever anyone gave me and that didn't end well but after that I have it but I do have friends that that still do sometimes so I'll end up like having to take care of them or something and,okay
892,okay,it kind of put it down around my my fun
893,it kind of put it down around my my fun,huh okay so on the one side some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed sort of carefree and kind of let loose a little bit more on the other hand there's a little bit more I guess planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can and then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck your your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend you drink too much okay any other not-so-good things about the alcohol
894,huh okay so on the one side some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed sort of carefree and kind of let loose a little bit more on the other hand there's a little bit more I guess planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can and then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck your your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend you drink too much okay any other not-so-good things about the alcohol,yeah people can get a little like sloppy I guess like they're all loose like with people and corners doing things that should be done in private and that kind of stuff
895,so you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't mean busy,yeah
896,yeah,got it okay all right well you mentioned a couple times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the a dangerous aspect of the drinking why did you make those decisions
897,got it okay all right well you mentioned a couple times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the a dangerous aspect of the drinking why did you make those decisions,I just I you know have an aunt who is an alcoholic so I I see like the issues that are involved and I've seen movies and things I know that drunk driving is an issue so I you know I want to be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like I someone's house or someone's parents home or something but so I like I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I want to limit that and still be able to have fun
898,okay yeah it sounds kind of similar to your your value of respect too so on the one hand you the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start if there's too much then,it sort of defeats the purpose
899,it sort of defeats the purpose,right and then with the respect one of the things you mentioned is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries not sort of cross lines how do you think that the drinking fits in with that
900,right and then with the respect one of the things you mentioned is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries not sort of cross lines how do you think that the drinking fits in with that,in terms of what in terms of respect I think well in a way I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things I'm putting things in it that shouldn't be there and then but in terms of hot ways I am respecting myself I am I'm respecting myself by like trying to stay in someone's house and like trying to limit my drinking so I don't get to that blacked out like throwing up and everything and try to you know let loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not going to go with some random person I met in - I don't know where to do I don't know what and things like that
901,in terms of what in terms of respect I think well in a way I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things I'm putting things in it that shouldn't be there and then but in terms of hot ways I am respecting myself I am I'm respecting myself by like trying to stay in someone's house and like trying to limit my drinking so I don't get to that blacked out like throwing up and everything and try to you know let loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not going to go with some random person I met in - I don't know where to do I don't know what and things like that,okay so you're sort of looking for that balance yeah how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit but about crossover okay and what have you come up with it at this point do you have sort of a limit that you stick to or
902,okay so you're sort of looking for that balance yeah how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit but about crossover okay and what have you come up with it at this point do you have sort of a limit that you stick to or,usually well I start off by make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in it how much is in it so that way I control how much I drink so I'll usually just you know get one of those cups and then make one drink and then I'll try to make it last as long as possible and I'll be like all right this is my one drink and I'm good in that way I still have something in my cup some people aren't going to be like oh here have some more like no I'm good I have mine and I'll still be you know having some to like let loose a little
903,usually well I start off by make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in it how much is in it so that way I control how much I drink so I'll usually just you know get one of those cups and then make one drink and then I'll try to make it last as long as possible and I'll be like all right this is my one drink and I'm good in that way I still have something in my cup some people aren't going to be like oh here have some more like no I'm good I have mine and I'll still be you know having some to like let loose a little,mm-hmm and do you feel like that's working pretty well for you or you sometimes exceed that limit or or what do you think
904,mm-hmm and do you feel like that's working pretty well for you or you sometimes exceed that limit or or what do you think,for the most part it works pretty well because like I said people you know people come asking me trying to pressure me I'll be like no I'm good I have you know I still have so I'm like I'll get some later and then never end up getting anything but sometimes they'll be like hey let's take a shot and everyone's got it around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot and then at that point I'll be like oh well maybe I can take one more and that's when I start you know falling into
905,for the most part it works pretty well because like I said people you know people come asking me trying to pressure me I'll be like no I'm good I have you know I still have so I'm like I'll get some later and then never end up getting anything but sometimes they'll be like hey let's take a shot and everyone's got it around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot and then at that point I'll be like oh well maybe I can take one more and that's when I start you know falling into,okay
906,okay,too much
907,too much,so a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you like
908,so a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you like,I'd
909,I'd,like to make some adjustments to to make it a little smoother okay so kind of thinking along those lines how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself
910,like to make some adjustments to to make it a little smoother okay so kind of thinking along those lines how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself,um I'd like to make sure that I you know in terms of respecting myself of my body I'd like to you know try to drink less
911,um I'd like to make sure that I you know in terms of respecting myself of my body I'd like to you know try to drink less,okay
912,okay,like I you know it is nice to let loose and have fun but I'd also like it to be so you know I'm not damaging my body and I like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like 22
913,like I you know it is nice to let loose and have fun but I'd also like it to be so you know I'm not damaging my body and I like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like 22,mm-hmm
914,mm-hmm,and um you know have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group as a community
915,uh-huh so kind of combined he has goals okay so you're you have a goal it sounds like of actually cutting back on your drinking how important is it to you to work on that goal on on the scale of one to ten where one is not at all important antennas it's the most important thing right now,I'd say about like like a six or a seven oh I like to work on it but you know if I get around to it I get around to if I don't I don't
916,I'd say about like like a six or a seven oh I like to work on it but you know if I get around to it I get around to if I don't I don't,uh-huh well why did you say six or seven rather than like a four
917,uh-huh well why did you say six or seven rather than like a four,um because I still think it's it's important
918,um because I still think it's it's important,uh-huh
919,uh-huh,I still you know like I said I don't want my body tried specially going to my school like I know how things affect your body and also affect your your social and your schoolwork and things like that I know that once I get to college it's not it's not gonna gonna work out being you know drinking every weekend and I'm like trying to wake up early and go to school take an exam I know that's not that's not feasible it's not a good idea
920,yeah looking ahead you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for years now okay well how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to,I think
921,I think,on that same scale from one to ten
922,on that same scale from one to ten,I think if I made the decision I was going to for sure then I think definitely like a ten I know I
923,I think if I made the decision I was going to for sure then I think definitely like a ten I know I,oh wow okay why did you say ten
924,oh wow okay why did you say ten,it's just because I know that once I make the decision I know I can making the decision in the first place okay weather
925,it's just because I know that once I make the decision I know I can making the decision in the first place okay weather,okay and so you mentioned you know quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that
926,okay and so you mentioned you know quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that,um I'm thinking of maybe like trying to convince my friends without sounding you know dorky or something be like hey you know let's just stay in today like let's not go out or something or just be like hey I'm not like I'm not going to drink today and even if my friends do like being okay with them drinking around me not doing it and then then being okay with me drinking me not drinking and them doing whatever they want
927,um I'm thinking of maybe like trying to convince my friends without sounding you know dorky or something be like hey you know let's just stay in today like let's not go out or something or just be like hey I'm not like I'm not going to drink today and even if my friends do like being okay with them drinking around me not doing it and then then being okay with me drinking me not drinking and them doing whatever they want,so sort of trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking okay does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or
928,so sort of trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking okay does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or,I think so I think it's it's very feasible I think it's possible
929,I think so I think it's it's very feasible I think it's possible,okay um so I guess we'll talk about less alcohol activities and just making some notes to myself and then maybe I'm reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved okay so that's that goal sounds feasible you said would it be okay if we met in a couple weeks to sort of see how it's going
930,okay um so I guess we'll talk about less alcohol activities and just making some notes to myself and then maybe I'm reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved okay so that's that goal sounds feasible you said would it be okay if we met in a couple weeks to sort of see how it's going,I think so that's good
931,I think so that's good,does that sound like something you'd like to do okay well I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me and you know it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself really ambitious goals and going to medical school and you know becoming a psychiatrist or some some other form of physician you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there and it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a lot of friends who you feel probably would be supportive even if you cut down on alcohol and that you know there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body and your health you school performance and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of drinking too much so yeah you know it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place and as long as you're willing and interested in meeting again and be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going
