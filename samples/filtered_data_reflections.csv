0,hey Monica how are you doing today,I'm okay right now but I'm a little anxious because thinking about how Black Friday is soon and my friends want to go to the mall for Black Friday but I really can't go and I want to go but I really to interesting
1,so it sounds like you really want to go to Black Friday with your friends you're feeling a little anxious about it,yeah Monaco but interesting but I was thinking about it and maybe if I could make an image or something that I could use while I'm there maybe I'd be able to go so I was wondering if I could give you that very well
2,that sounds like a great idea can absolutely do that,okay
3,so we have some materials on the table but if you'd like to use anything else that we've used previously just let me know and I'll get them to you for you,um do you have a Sharpie
4,it do did you have a color that you wanted,black maybe
5,all right here,this
6,welcome,ok I think I'm done
7,all right is there anything you'd like to tell me about it,well I'm sure um I drew mountains and lake because when I think about things like Unicom I think of nature so I drew a scene that I think would keep me calm
8,so it sounds like nature and mountains are coming to you do you think that this will be helpful I'm black Franny,yes as long as I can remember to think about this image when I'm there but maybe I'll bring it with me when I go so I can refer to it when I'm anxious
9,that sounds like a great idea,hi there I'm just here to get a refill on my insulin prescription
10,hi my name is Laura I'm the pharmacist let me just look you up in the computer,sure
11,your person laughing,reset feels
12,and your date of birth,April 28 1962
13,okay I see that you've filled it here before,mm-hmm
14,tell me about how you're using the insulin,okay um so usually at night I'll check my blood sugar and then if it's pretty high like about like 15 or so I'll use it that day so usually end up using it about three or four times a week
15,so you're testing a lot,mm-hmm
16,at least every day,yes
17,and then you are using the unplanned when you feel like your blood sugars are running high,even exactly
18,and how do you feel your implants working for that,I think it's good because my sugars aren't about 14 every day so it must be working it must work her maybe even a couple of days so it's pretty effective
19,do you feel like you've seen some real improvements on that,yeah definitely
20,okay so tell me why you're only using it when your blood sugar goes high,oh okay yeah so I was supposed to use it everyday at first I think um which I was like the first week that I had it I started injecting everyday I don't carry about a week it's your to hurt when I was inject here so that's when I started doing it less often thinking if I kind of gave this skin a couple days to heal it wouldn't hurt as much by the next time I I gave myself the injection
21,so you were experiencing some pain who knows what I'd like you to kind of use it a little left off,yeah it hurts a lot when I check
22,and you feel like that's really impacting your day,mm-hmm I do yeah
23,okay so sounds like you've seen some improvement your blood Sugar's have been sometimes under control what have you discuss with your doctor recently,um why has she haven't seen my doctor since I started the insulin so I guess I haven't told him I'm not using it every day like he wanted I hope you I hope you understand
24,well you're here today for the refill and it seems like you're really committed to getting your blood Sugar's under control,mm-hmm
25,there are some options that we could discuss about how to reduce pain when you inject,okay that sounds good
26,there are also some suggestions that I could make about how to keep your blood Sugar's under control best,okay I like below 15
27,hi John,hi Justin I'm dropping off a new prescription
28,no problem I have this in stock but I do notice that these prescriptions from the hospital can you tell me more about that,yeah I was in the hospital for about ten days I had this infection where the fluids are oh I need my refills they didn't give me any new prescriptions in the hospital
29,I did have some auto refills for you in the pharmacy unfortunately to return to stock since you weren't able to pick them up but if you give me twenty minutes I can get them all ready for you,I twisted my ankle leaving the apartment this morning it's hurting real bad
30,that's terrible John asbestos in your first day coming back from the hospital but I did want to talk to you about one thing the ibuprofen is you're holding especially with your medical condition will have a tendency to reduce blood flow to your kidneys,really but they told me I couldn't take Tylenol but I thought that ibuprofen would be okay at the hospital when I first got there they said my kidneys weren't doing too good but when I left they said everything was back to normal
31,well if you don't mind John if we can go over to the side area and I can discuss with you further kind of see your ankle John,sure
32,does look swollen does it hurt anymore mark when you move it does,no it's the same
33,I think the best thing for now is to get a cold pack and elevate your ankle to 45 degrees let me grab that for you real quick so this is the instant cold pack so just basically to activate it you just squeeze in place it around your ankle and elevate it to 45 degrees and the reason why I feel more comfortable with this recommendation is because you've told me about your kidney problem in the hospital I really don't feel comfortable with you're using ibuprofen and because if your liver condition the fluid is pooling in your abdomen which is restricting the blood flow to the kidney ibuprofen will further restrict blood flow to the kidney and your blood pressure medication the lisinopril there's normally a very good medication that will further reduce blood flow to the kidney and the total effect of all three of these factors will drastically reduce buffer to the kidney and the kidney failure and that's why I feel more comfortable with the cold pack recommendation and if you have further questions we can talk to your doctor,thanks for letting me know about this I certainly don't want to hurt my kidneys I got enough problems
34,that's why we're here and if you want to walk with me back to the pharmacy I can get all your prescriptions rung up for you you,Welbeck I'm just not sure that I'm ready to quit I just I just don't think I can do this right now
35,so you're really not confident that you'd be successful long-term,yeah pretty much
36,you know like I know quitting is really hard and it takes a lot of strength to go through that but is it the hardest thing you've ever done,what must be because I haven't quite yet
37,well in all seriousness is I know there's other hard things you've been through so if quitting really the toughest thing you've ever done,no I'm Courtney I mean going to my divorce was difficult
38,and you got through it,yeah but there was just different circumstances
39,it is a different type of difficulty you're right and I don't want to make light of that but what I'm the point I'm trying to make with you is that it was difficult and you rose to the challenge and you got through it,yeah that's true
40,so what I know of you is that when you're faced with a tough challenge like a divorce you rise to the occasion and you manage to get through it and you come out on top so are you ready for the challenge of quitting,yeah you know I hear what you're saying but you know I just don't want to be a failure I don't want to let people down I don't want to let my family down and I I just don't think I'm ready
41,well I do totally respect your decision if you really don't want to quit and you're not open to it then you know that is your choice whatever you choose to do about your smoking habit really is your choice and I do respect that so where do we go from here,well I don't want to quit right now but I know that in the past cutting down has helped me
42,cutting down that would be a great step I mean that would be wonderful so I know you've tried before what else have you learned what other lessons have you learned from quitting I'm guessing you've learned a lot of lessons,well I know in the past the nicotine gum has helped me I just didn't really care for the taste
43,well I have some ideas on that if you'd be open to hearing them,sure
44,they've got a lot of new flavors on the gum they're cinnamon and orange and juicy fruit which is a popular one and mint and I've had a lot of people have favorable things to say about the new flavors,that's something I didn't know that so you think you might want to try it again again in addition to cutting back
45,how about if I cut back for a month and then I'll try the gum,I think that is an excellent idea and I think that you really will be able to do it this time
46,you Rachel it hurt coming today what brings you in,well so I've been working with the weight management clinic and I just when I found out that this was an opportunity I thought why not use this as another resource to help me lose weight
47,and why why do you want to lose weight,well so really recently actually my older sister has had a lot of health concerns relate to her weight and it just sort of jostled me a little bit because we're so similar
48,really related to your sister,yeah so I've been this weight for a while but like now I feel like this is really the time for me to start making some changes
49,what kind of problems sister experience,well so she has some high cholesterol and high blood pressure and I guess those are things that were running my family but I'm really worried because my grandmother has suffered from a stroke and I definitely don't want to do that
50,there's big change gears to get healthy,yeah I mean another birthday rolled around and I just realized that I'm not getting any younger thank you thank you but yeah so there's some pressure there too
51,so there's been some big things going on your life that's really prompted your push for weight loss so I just want to check it really quick and so on a scale of one to ten with one being really super important and have to do it starting today where are you in turn taken away,oh I would definitely say a ten
52,okay,we want right now for me is really really important
53,and what puts you out of 10,just kind of all these reminders in the last year and then I'm getting a little bit older all of those things together make it a 10
54,okay bad idea on in that same scale with one being not confident at all to 10 being super super confident where would you say your are in terms of your confidence to actually lose the way,Oh honestly I would probably say that I'm like a five or six with confidence
55,and what what promise you to pick a five or six,I just like been tried to lose weight before and those things certainly have failed as I still I'm the same way
56,okay,that's what really only leaves me at five or six
57,okay so what can we do to get you at say like a nine or ten level of confidence,I think I would be more confident if I understood like how do you use some of the gym equipment a little bit more so it's not something that I feel really comfortable doing I just don't I know feel very confident when I'm in there except to use the bike and there are elliptical so some of that could be I would really like to do some strength training but I just don't know how
58,hi Andrea thanks for coming in,thank you
59,so I don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here so I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself basically my job is to meet with all of the students I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going different behaviors that you might be engaging in and thinking about any changes you might want to make for your life if you decide that you do it's not my job to change you I couldn't even if I wanted to that's not my role at all it's really to help you think about you know how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward that sound okay all right so why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself,sure um as you know I'm Andrea I uh I'm a junior I'm in the marching band I played at center sacks I mean yeah I'm also in the little bit of a band geek I play you know the Wind Ensemble and the Jazz Band things like that
60,wow you really are involved in music,yeah
61,when did you start,I started playing about 10 years ago actually
62,Wow,yeah I start on the violin first and then I went on explored a little with the piano clarinet finally found the tenor sax hmm yeah
63,very cool I've always wanted to be good at music all right so it sounds like you're in band and a few other musical ensembles any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun,um you know just hanging out with my friends or go to the beach things like that
64,it's kind of everyday sort of thing okay tell me a little bit about your family,uh well I have one older brother he's about eight and a half old years older than me my parents and I have dog
65,cute what kind of dogs,the golden retriever
66,oh nice,I'm a big boy
67,very fun all right and how are things going in school for you,pretty good grades have been pretty all right still like 3.7 ish
68,okay great so you're doing well what sorts of goals do you have for after college or after high school,I'd like to you know I'd like to of course graduate high school hopefully go to a nice Ivy League school or I mean that might not happen and then I'd like to go on become a doctor study psychology you need to come a psychiatrist or something
69,okay you have some pretty big dreams,yeah
70,it's great that's really exciting to think about that and he's going to be looking forward to the future and those things all right well one thing I'm going to ask you about is um you know different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life whether it's you know their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies things like that so here's a little sheet that goes through just some basic values that might be more or less important to certain people like belonging or sense of community again cultural identity or family friendship modesty religion respect self-determination and spirituality so when you think about yourself which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life,um I think a sense of community and belonging
71,okay,I think those two and um respect respect
72,okay can you tell me a little bit about why you picked those three,yeah well I think the community belonging I kind of related them um you know how I said I was in the marching band I really you know I really enjoyed being in like that team setting of you know being with other people and all working to work together towards that one goal
73,mm-hmm,and then in terms of respect I I kind of view that as one of like my major like rules like I I really do think respect is important to respect myself or respect those around me so
74,okay,I place great importance in that
75,okay great so sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of belonging like you said a sense of purpose anyway and then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing it's not just Authority but respecting yourself respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you okay that's great all right well one of the things I want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends so what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends,um sometimes if you just you know go to the movies go to the beach like I had said or sometimes we just get together someone's house play some board games and hang out
76,mm-hmm and when you're hanging out with friends is there ever alcohol involved,yeah sometimes
77,okay can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene,uh well it's mostly just for for parties or party settings it's kind of to get things going and got everything loosened up as they say
78,mm-hmm and so when you go to parties most of the time there's alcohol there okay and how often do you think you would say you're drinking,I'd say um on a not busy month for instance I'd say about like two weekends out of the month two three
79,mm-hmm so about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink,the days that we drink are mostly like I said they're parties so it's more of that whole partying and dancing and you know having everyone have fun and then when we don't it's a lot more relaxed it's a lot more hanging out playing board games watching a movie it's not yeah
80,so it really depends on what the activity is whether or not alcohols get,definitely
81,okay and do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus and that you're playing board games,I think of them as as different I think you know like in playing board games and things it's meant to be relaxing so it's nice to have like that kind of breather versus with a party it's a lot more energetic it's a after at all it's very draining
82,mm-hmm,but in the moment it's quite fun to dance and have
83,okay so there's sort of pros and cons,oh yeah
84,okay what are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol,um it's you know when we drink we we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not you know everyone's drinking together we're a lot more loosened up and relaxed and not really thinking about stresses or things like that but it can be when it's too much drinking it can be can be obviously bad
85,okay so sort of in the the too much drinking or our times can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol,um a lot of times it will make make people stupid yeah you know people make dumb decisions and things like that we we usually try to be as safe about it as possible so like sleepover friends house and so you know we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group so we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks but um definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're stupid when they're drunk can can be really stupid
86,hmm so you're trying to like you said not engage in really dangerous activities you're trying to stay put you're not driving you're trying to stay with people that you trust but yet it sounds like there's still some some things happening,sometimes yeah
87,can you tell me a little bit about that,well I especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends like we drink too much and we hadn't up like throwing up and things like that that I don't that's not fun
88,yeah throwing up is never fun it's not and how often do you think that happened,for me that's happened to me once it was the first time I ever drank and it was it was a lot and you know what I was doing I was mixing all kinds of weird things I'm just kind of taking anything ever anyone gave me and that didn't end well but after that I have it but I do have friends that that still do sometimes so I'll end up like having to take care of them or something and
89,okay,it kind of put it down around my my fun
90,huh okay so on the one side some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed sort of carefree and kind of let loose a little bit more on the other hand there's a little bit more I guess planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can and then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck your your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend you drink too much okay any other not-so-good things about the alcohol,yeah people can get a little like sloppy I guess like they're all loose like with people and corners doing things that should be done in private and that kind of stuff
91,so you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't mean busy,yeah
92,got it okay all right well you mentioned a couple times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the a dangerous aspect of the drinking why did you make those decisions,I just I you know have an aunt who is an alcoholic so I I see like the issues that are involved and I've seen movies and things I know that drunk driving is an issue so I you know I want to be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like I someone's house or someone's parents home or something but so I like I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I want to limit that and still be able to have fun
93,okay yeah it sounds kind of similar to your your value of respect too so on the one hand you the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start if there's too much then,it sort of defeats the purpose
94,right and then with the respect one of the things you mentioned is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries not sort of cross lines how do you think that the drinking fits in with that,in terms of what in terms of respect I think well in a way I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things I'm putting things in it that shouldn't be there and then but in terms of hot ways I am respecting myself I am I'm respecting myself by like trying to stay in someone's house and like trying to limit my drinking so I don't get to that blacked out like throwing up and everything and try to you know let loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not going to go with some random person I met in - I don't know where to do I don't know what and things like that
95,okay so you're sort of looking for that balance yeah how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit but about crossover okay and what have you come up with it at this point do you have sort of a limit that you stick to or,usually well I start off by make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in it how much is in it so that way I control how much I drink so I'll usually just you know get one of those cups and then make one drink and then I'll try to make it last as long as possible and I'll be like all right this is my one drink and I'm good in that way I still have something in my cup some people aren't going to be like oh here have some more like no I'm good I have mine and I'll still be you know having some to like let loose a little
96,mm-hmm and do you feel like that's working pretty well for you or you sometimes exceed that limit or or what do you think,for the most part it works pretty well because like I said people you know people come asking me trying to pressure me I'll be like no I'm good I have you know I still have so I'm like I'll get some later and then never end up getting anything but sometimes they'll be like hey let's take a shot and everyone's got it around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot and then at that point I'll be like oh well maybe I can take one more and that's when I start you know falling into
97,okay,too much
98,so a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you like,I'd
99,like to make some adjustments to to make it a little smoother okay so kind of thinking along those lines how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself,um I'd like to make sure that I you know in terms of respecting myself of my body I'd like to you know try to drink less
100,mm-hmm,and um you know have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group as a community
101,uh-huh so kind of combined he has goals okay so you're you have a goal it sounds like of actually cutting back on your drinking how important is it to you to work on that goal on on the scale of one to ten where one is not at all important antennas it's the most important thing right now,I'd say about like like a six or a seven oh I like to work on it but you know if I get around to it I get around to if I don't I don't
102,uh-huh well why did you say six or seven rather than like a four,um because I still think it's it's important
103,uh-huh,I still you know like I said I don't want my body tried specially going to my school like I know how things affect your body and also affect your your social and your schoolwork and things like that I know that once I get to college it's not it's not gonna gonna work out being you know drinking every weekend and I'm like trying to wake up early and go to school take an exam I know that's not that's not feasible it's not a good idea
104,yeah looking ahead you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for years now okay well how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to,I think
105,on that same scale from one to ten,I think if I made the decision I was going to for sure then I think definitely like a ten I know I
106,oh wow okay why did you say ten,it's just because I know that once I make the decision I know I can making the decision in the first place okay weather
107,okay and so you mentioned you know quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that,um I'm thinking of maybe like trying to convince my friends without sounding you know dorky or something be like hey you know let's just stay in today like let's not go out or something or just be like hey I'm not like I'm not going to drink today and even if my friends do like being okay with them drinking around me not doing it and then then being okay with me drinking me not drinking and them doing whatever they want
108,so sort of trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking okay does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or,I think so I think it's it's very feasible I think it's possible
109,okay um so I guess we'll talk about less alcohol activities and just making some notes to myself and then maybe I'm reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved okay so that's that goal sounds feasible you said would it be okay if we met in a couple weeks to sort of see how it's going,I think so that's good
110,does that sound like something you'd like to do okay well I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me and you know it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself really ambitious goals and going to medical school and you know becoming a psychiatrist or some some other form of physician you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there and it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a lot of friends who you feel probably would be supportive even if you cut down on alcohol and that you know there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body and your health you school performance and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of drinking too much so yeah you know it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place and as long as you're willing and interested in meeting again and be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going,I'd like to
111,alright great so I'll plan to see you then in a few more weeks,Thanks
112,hi Lucy nice to see you today how you been going,yeah well thanks
113,great I'm just fully get started has anything changed with your medical history since I last saw you like any new medications or serious operations,No
114,great and is anything maybe worrying you about your teeth or your gums today,I think I might have a hole in my tooth
115,oh no what makes you say that,I can feel it with my tongue and it's a bit sensitive
116,mmm well let's lie you back I'll pop some gloves on and we'll have a little look Lucy it definitely looks like you need a filling um I'd love to help you figure out why you've got this new hole in your tooth do you mind if I ask you a few questions so we can try and figure it out,Yeah of course
117,great yeah it says here that you're drinking soft drinks in between meals what do you know about the effect of soft drinks on your teeth,I know it's not good for them
118,that's right um the bacteria in your mouth can use the soft drink to create acid that eats into the tooth surface and causes the holes the more that your teeth are coated in the sugar the more likely it is that you'll develop a hole did you know the one can of soft drink can have 10 teaspoons of sugar in it,I didn't know that so I shouldn't have soft drinks at all I'm not sure I could do that
119,yeah I understand it does sound like you're worried about getting holes in your teeth though there are a few options that you can do to help improve how you consume sugar would you like to hear about those,well I don't like getting feelings so that would be great
120,yeah probably drinking soft drink you could try drinking it all in one go instead of sipping on it or you could try drinking just at mealtimes instead of in between meals so does either of those sound like they might work for you,yeah I mainly sort of drink soft drinks in between meals though maybe I could just have them with lunch and dinner
121,great I'm in Romania to get a break from the sugar I sort of on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the most how motivated do you feel you are to make this change,I don't like getting feelings so an 8 or a 9
122,great and you maybe have any ideas that you could implement to help you avoid having soft drinks in between meals,I could carry a water bottle around with me
123,great that's a really good strategy and waters great for you too umm you can also try chewing sugar-free gum I mean is that something you're interested in,I might give the water bottle a try first
124,okay cool well look I'll put a little note in your file and the next time I see you if it's okay I'll check how you're going with avoiding soft drinks between meals,yeah that'd be fun and hopefully I won't have any holes next time
125,so Jane it sounds like you're angry with your supervisor would what would I be right in saying that,well I think I'm pretty angry
126,all right look maybe to help me understand you know more about that anger I'm wondering if you could you know choose two or three pictures here that look like how you were angry at the time which which of the cards here that would show how angry you were okay don't I might just take a look at those okay it does look like anger doesn't it it's a pretty big anger so after you'd had that you know a big thing with your mum you you went to your room right,well she got really angry at me because on the way to my room my idiot sister got in the way so I pushed her out of the way she's just annoying so then I went into my room the only place that I really feel safe slammed the door and then mums favorite picture fell on the floor
127,thank you for sharing that with me because it really and being for being so honest about your anger because what it does is help I don't know if it's helping you but it's certainly helping me to understand that this is really big for you and it's a big expression but surprisingly you know anger anger's a good thing in a way because it's it's letting you know that something wasn't right and wasn't fair that he he just did change the thing without your permission without you knowing so in some ways you had a right to be angry but what happens what I heard you saying in as you were telling me what happened next what happened next was that your anger took charge and he it did more than what it's meant to do your your anger is just just to let you know that you're angry okay but what it did what I feel it did it just pushed you out of the road and said I'm I'm taking control here so Jane when you were angry did you feel it anywhere in your body,well my neck is really sore and its really paining and and my shoulders I just it's really like it's it just feels like I've been I've been hit by something
128,the end of the day that that pushing your sister over and yelling at your mum did,it's made it worse yeah
129,yes which is hard to see at the time I I do understand that but what I'm thinking is that if sometimes if we tell our anger look thank you you've done a good job it doesn't have to get so angry then because you you know you you're telling it that it's thank you you've done a good job you've let me know I'm angry now I'm going to deal with it from here,you have to help me with that a bit i think
130,hi I'm Amy the pharmacist so I understand you have some questions,hi I'm Mario and my doctor suggested I talked to a pharmacist about quitting smoking do you have the time for this
131,sure why don't you tell me a little bit about what you're thinking how soon you'd like to quit and why you want to quit,my cholesterol and my blood pressure are high my father and my uncle both had heart attacks when they were pretty young so my doctor's been telling me that if I quit I'll cut down on my chances of having a heart attack
132,that's correct quitting would be important for you and it will reduce your chances of having heart problems,so that's the situation I've tried to quit a couple of times before but it didn't work so what I was hoping is that you could go over the different options and help me pick the best one
133,hmm I'd be happy to do that first tell me exactly which products you used and more importantly how you use them,first I tried the gum I like to chew gum so I thought this would be good so I chewed about three to four pieces of gum a day but I was miserable and I started smoking after four days then I tried the patch a couple of months later I felt pretty good for about a week so I quit using it didn't think I needed it anymore started smoking two days later
134,based on what you've told me it sounds like you didn't get the full benefit of the product a few pieces of gum won't get enough nicotine into your body to make you comfortable you need at least nine pieces a day for it to be effective and it has to be used in a very specific way not chewed like regular chewing gum,I admit I didn't read the directions last time
135,as for the patch sounds like it worked for you you just didn't stay on it long enough we recommend 10 to 12 weeks and this gets enough nicotine into your body to help reduce most of the withdrawal symptoms while you work on learning to live your life without cigarettes you were able to quit for a week with it so it seems like it might be a good choice now but there are others as well,yeah my doctor said something about a pill I didn't like the taste of the gum much
136,well that's understandable but you should know there are new flavors that my patients say tastes better to be honest all the medications are effective it's just a matter of what you prefer you've already tried the patch there's also a nicotine lozenge a nasal spray an oral inhaler in tablet form we have bupropion which you've probably heard called zyban and there's a newer medication varenicline or chantix,yeah I've heard of those but I think I'd rather stick with the patch and this time I'm gonna make sure I keep it on long enough it
137,sounds like a good choice for you and given that you have some experience with it and you know that it works for you um how many cigarettes do you smoke a day,about a pack a day
138,okay so you'll want to start with the 21 milligram patch for six weeks and then the 14 milligram patch for two weeks and then the seven milligram patch for the last two weeks it's pretty easy to use in the morning of your quit day I want you to put one patch on a hairless part of your upper body and leave it on for 24 hours and the next morning you take that off you put another patch on in a different location you want to switch site so you don't get any skin irritation if you have trouble sleeping you can take it off before you go to bed you read the directions on the box and if you have any questions let me know,okay I'm gonna try it again and read the directions and stick with it this time
139,one more thing there are two parts to smoking so there are two parts to quitting it's an addiction to nicotine and a habit the patch will take care of the physical addiction and help with the withdrawal symptoms but you'll have to make changes in your behavior if you want to stay quit for good,yeah dr. Ward mentioned that to me and he gave me the card for this quitting line
140,I can I help you,yeah I hope so um my workplace is just gone smoke-free hey I'm not not very happy about it I'm going to keep smoking but I was worrying if there's anything that can help be like get through the day it's like you know go get my beer and smoke cigarettes after work
141,so your workplace just went smoke free you're not too pleased huh,no I'm not going to quit smoking oh my god I like it it helps me relax so I mean I don't see what the big deal is
142,okay tell me a little bit about how smoking fits in your day it'll help with the,I mean I suppose a little less than a pack a day it's not too bad um the I probably smoked for the last five years but I I mean I could quit if I wanted to but I don't really want to right now
143,okay so you feel like right now smoking is a pretty important part of your life it's not something you're ready to change but if the time came when you did decide to quit you feel pretty confident that you could go ahead and do that,sure I can quit
144,okay what makes you so confident,well I mean I don't see why I couldn't although I have not ever tried to quit I mean it's just something that I do for fun you know I'm breaks at work in the morning and have to work
145,mm-hmm and so in terms of a readiness to actually go ahead and make a quit attempt where do you think you fall on the scale of one to ten where one is I'm not considering it at all and ten is I'm definitely ready I want to quit,I am probably - I haven't even thought about quitting and until this great announcement at work today I've been totally not gonna quit smoking
146,okay what made you say two instead of one,well I mean anything's possible I mean I I guess I could maybe be convinced yeah is there something I mean I are there things I can try that would make me like want to quit smoking
147,well there are a lot of products available now that can actually help you curb that urge to smoke we have products that can help to replace nicotine which can help to decrease withdrawal symptoms that you might experience when quitting or cutting down and also some medications that your doctor could prescribe for you that might take away even some of the desire to smoke,okay well that's good information I mean I'm not gonna do anything today I just need to know my options but that's encouraging if I decided to quit smoking I do have have at least tools to help me quit
148,sure and back to that skill you mentioned you said you're a - what do you think it would take to move you up to a four or five,I don't know I guess if my friends like if one of my friends decided like quit with me that would probably help too but I all my friends love to smoke so I don't see that happening in the near future
149,sure I wonder if now that your workplace is going smoke-free if there will be some people at work who are planning to quit,that's a good point I hadn't really thought about that that's a good idea
150,okay well it sounds like you're really here just for information today I'm happy to help you pick out some of these products if and when you decide that the time is right for you,okay well thanks a lot
151,hi I'm Andrea,until nice to meet you
152,nice to meet you so what brings you here today,well I just been feeling really stressed out lately because it's coming to the holidays and my teachers have decided to lower the class with everything these next couple weeks so it is overwhelmed with it all I had I have like feel like I have so much stuff to do and what are those personalities like for crafting a variant I can't with what I have to do and I wanted to well but I trust I'll be doing that and have the holidays I'm trying to prepare to my home Thanksgiving lots of stuff going on then and then boy is coming to visit me for Christmas
153,that's nice so hearing me say is that you're stressed with all this going on at school and preparing for the holidays that's that big it's really a lot on your plate,it's like if it was just the work if you find that I'm stressed about that too and I'm worried about me even think oh it sounds kind of silly but you know your boyfriend coming home for Christmas is kind of a big deal
154,for sure,and it's like I wanted to like my family but I I'm not excited you didn't put him to be bored you know I mean that's I shouldn't even be in my mind you know I should be totally focused on school right now it's just
155,so do you feel like you but obviously we're this far on this semester how well do you think you've done well thus far,yeah actually I've been doing a lot better in this semester and I think that because of it I wanted to want to keep to move on I want to get I like I'm over a cheer instance I like skip good grades but that makes the procrastination like I'm really good at working under pressure but I can't work under pressure with this up because if I don't start doing in advance I won't get it done and I'm trying to figure out how to just balance to you
156,do you think if you do what are some options that you see you may have preparing yourself to get the assignments done,oh I guess just I've considered you know being very turning off all of my electronics of when my computer I'll need it to do the whole market and doing like a to-do list and just really disciplining myself that you know I have to do it but as soon as I get my computer and like Facebook and gave you the things that distract me I keep finding myself putting it up and putting it off
157,have you tried anything that might have works in past -,well we recently had fire home and we did the whole fascinating and I fasted like my computer completely I was a lot more with internet at all and to really do anything with electronics and I think that just having that goal in my mind and because it was forgotten I was able to really just not do it and I did so much homework during that week that I've ever done so maybe just really sitting at one with God could help me to better I should I should do it it's just so much easier said than done you know because we're college students who want to go have fun and we wanted to be with our friends but I mean I've had to cancel all my plans and this is why purple holidays at lunch sometime a benefit just frustrating me the teachers you know I mean I know that they did all something followed but there's just so much to do
158,it's overwhelming that getting all your stuff inside working out strategies,I think that you know girls are always overachievers and we can't just chill and like even my fans always like why don't you just relax they're plump up your deal but I'm trying to think that but I don't like it's a big deal school some things ago because I'm not really talented with my music okay dance or any of those things but so many people are into it so school is like my gift I do good and I understand it so to not feel secure and that is kind of
159,so you put a lot of pressure on yourself when I hear saying it's cool because you like that -,hey I guess it is a lot of pressure I mean I remember in high school my brother was like the good pop and he's older than me he would come back with bad grades and I would come off straight A's I'm so excited you know tell me about your day Ethan Anthony was just like give him all these pitches he did so bad the whole time I always wanted to shine [Music] maybe I do need to just relax and know that the day-to-day thing
160,do you feel like you've done involve thus far the semester your classes,I think I've got some of my closest I'm not sharing because we don't really get product reports in them but both classes I do you know yeah I'm doing well and but you know there's so much riding on these next few weeks I don't do well on these assignments like it could totally mess up all that work so
161,so your primary concern really is for the speak you have to get done this week I remember me just said earlier about creating possibly the creating the to-do list or do you think do you think those things that you mentioned earlier would be good,probably just do it talk about it but I guess it's just nice to know that
162,completion with that and going the holiday do you feel like when you do how do you feel stressful week,toy was always really really relaxing so I think that'll be good it's kind of like a reward for getting through it but then I have I mean these goodies won't need a week and I feel like we'll be doing a lot in preparation for my boyfriend coming for Christmas so it won't be everlasting back for three more weeks of school and then like columns here and no it's like breach I mean it should be
163,so it seems like you have a lot going on this week but you seem motivated and now to complete it and you have the break to look forward to but you said it so that sounds like you you're almost there you're going to make it so it's good hearing from you [Music],I pick up a prescription

170,pinnacle okay and I have here according your profile that you have a sensitivity of statins which is the type of medications is that correct,yeah
171,okay and according to your profile it looks like you're taking likes in Aprill hydrochlorothiazide and simvastatin which is one of those medications,yeah I'm not taking this instead
172,not taking any more okay great no problem then what happened when you took the statin,uh you know I started to get a really bad pain in my legs and that's what led me to go to the doctor you ran tests and that's when he said I had sensitivity to it
173,okay well hopefully you won't have any issues like that with this one I'll be sure to go over this with you okay,okay
174,so the name of this medication is gem fib Raziel it's the generic for low pay,okay
175,now before I go into more detail about this medication what concerns do you have that you'd like me to address with you here today,honestly the the pain in my legs I'm a landscaper so it made it so that I couldn't work so I mean that's my biggest concern the doctor said you know that it would help to be on this and
176,certainly I understand that and hopefully you won't have the same issues with this one I will talk about that before I get to that though what did your doctor say this medication is used for,lower cholesterol you know something about triglycerides
177,we see this a lot with lowering cholesterol especially triglycerides which are a type of cholesterol,okay
178,now how did your doctor tell you that you're going to use this medication,twice a day
179,twice a day so you'll take one tablet which is 600 milligrams and just like it says on here it's actually two tablets so you'll be taking a total of 1200 milligrams and you'll be doing that by mouth twice a day so the best time to take it is about a half hour before breakfast and then again a half hour before dinner if you can remember that,yeah
180,yeah,okay okay cool
181,okay now one important thing about this medication is this is in addition to diet and exercise so keep doing that healthy diets all that exercise to help lower your cholesterol as well,all right okay
182,now what side effects did your doctor tell you that this medication made cause,I don't know I mean he you know he did say that hopefully would be better for my my legs right
183,hopefully it will now it's still possible it may cause that you are in kind of a high dose most people do fine on it I mean it's a different it works in a different way than the statin so if you experience that just let your doctor know but most people do do fine,okay
184,now other side effects you might experience you might have a little bit of stomach upset if that happens just take it with food and that should help okay,okay
185,as far as storing it keep it in this bottle that'll protect it from light and from moisture keep it at room temperature you know nothing fancy,yeah

190,absolutely I understand your frustration try to stick with it you know because it is important we lower your cholesterol but like I said if you start to notice any muscle pain let your doctor know there's other options he may be able to switch you and most people do do just fine on it,okay sounds good
191,all right great what other questions do you have for me,I think that's it I think we're good
192,all right very good so just to kind of summarize make sure that you kind of stick with it if you do start to notice any muscle pain make sure you report that right away,yeah
193,take it a half hour before breakfast and again a half hour before dinner if you can but it's important just to remember to take that twice a day,Oh kind

195,thank you very much I really appreciate your time today,yeah all right
196,there's great seeing you thank you for coming to diabetes clinic today my name is Mark Smith I'm a pharmacist I work with dr. Pham and I we run the diabetes clinic and we basically serve to educate our patients so that I can better manage their their diabetes and looking at your chart I see that you are pre-diabetic so what we're going to do now is kind of focus on nutrition mostly diet and exercise okay,dr. Pham already made me get a nutritionist I know what you're going to tell me so Kyle Eve
197,okay okay that's fine I'm glad you had the opportunity to talk with the nutritionist I'm she's a very nice lady and she has some very valuable information do you mind telling me some of the things that she discuss with you,it's the same stuff you're gonna tell me
198,okay well I will show you what I normally go through with my patients and then you can let me know if there's any information that you covered with the nutritionist or any of the material it's new to you then that would be great as well basically we feel that going over the nutrition aspect of diabetes and pre-diabetes is so important there's so much that we can do without taking medications and we've seen many patients that have benefited from making just minor changes to their diet that are greatly impacted their health in a very positive way so to start off I'm just going to ask you a few questions about what you eat to get a better picture of your diet so first what did you have for breakfast,couple eggs bacon biscuits great
199,okay all right and then what about lunch,turkey sandwiches and chips
200,okay chips and then for dinner,spaghetti salad bread
201,okay spaghetti salad and bread okay so tell me then what about any snacking that you do throughout the day like any snacks or anything like that,I don't really snack but sometimes ice cream after dinner may be free in between meals benign occasion not very often
202,okay and also what kind of beverages and things that you drink what are some of the things that you drink throughout throughout your day,or constant constantly feeling hydrated some thirsty so I drink sweet tea all day long
203,okay okay well thanks for sharing a bit of information within this patient this kind of gives us a better idea of what you throughout the day so now I'm going to give you some information or show you some information about nutrition okay,all right know what you're going to say I need to eat less I've heard it all before it doesn't work for me so good
204,okay all right so that's that's that's my ministrations but just just kind of bear with me so when I gather from your best far as that you know already you're fully aware of the things that you need to do in order to live a healthy lifestyle and take care of yourself however you seem to find it difficult and you don't think that it works for you is that that's kind of the fish that I'm getting so explain to me what are some of the barriers that you feel exists that prevents you from eating healthier and losing weight,it's mostly the money it's expensive to buy foods that are healthy and I just can't afford it consistently also like foods it tastes good I hope these stuff doesn't taste good and I just don't want it and also my kids want the good taste in food so they wouldn't even eat it if I made healthy food
205,okay okay then I understand completely that finances can be a potential issue and an issue especially when it comes to eating healthy more importantly picking out the right healthy foods for your kids to end and also to have good taste is also a priority to you so tell me about you know we're going to switch and transition from diet and talk about exercise tell me about your normal exercise routine,honestly I only have one I haven't exercised in years just don't feel like it put all the money to join again
206,okay okay and then what are some of the barriers you believe that prevent you from exercising on a regular basis,well kids they take a lot of time group and money like I said gym memberships or there's several close to my home but they're too expensive for me to get and I just don't have enough time the kids take a ball a day of the day and then work
207,all right and then what what ultimate benefits let's talk about benefits what benefits that you feel that you can ultimately gain by by seeking out more nutritious foods and incorporating exercise into a daily regimen regimen and an overall losing weight what do you think would be the benefits of doing all that,I guess it's good for you dr. Pham always gets mad at me and says I'm not healthy and always talks about my weight
208,okay,maybe
209,okay maybe yes yes ma'am well and and then those things are exactly correct on what I would like to do miss Fisher I know that you're pressed for time I'm not going to take too much of your time but I would like to schedule min and I and basically sit down with you and kind of go over some some helpful alternatives and basically look at some cost effective type thing since cost is an issue with you and then also look at some resources that we can channel into when it comes to exercise you'll soon find out that some of the exercises that you can do they don't even require a gym membership so you know if that's something deal at because you mentioned to me that time and money are contouring for you so we basically want to work with you together to see if we can get something that that better suits you you know and get you on the right track when it comes to your pre-diabetes and overall losing weight so would you like to come in and scheduling Pullman with us about a week from now,yeah I mean you can help me with the finances and Ty
210,hi I'm Andrea,until nice to meet you
211,nice to meet you so what brings you here today,well I just been feeling really stressed out lately because it's coming to the holidays and my teachers have decided to lower the class with everything these next couple weeks so it is overwhelmed with it all I had I have like feel like I have so much stuff to do and what are those personalities like for crafting a variant I can't with what I have to do and I wanted to well but I trust I'll be doing that and have the holidays I'm trying to prepare to my home Thanksgiving lots of stuff going on then and then boy is coming to visit me for Christmas

221,completion with that and going the holiday do you feel like when you do how do you feel stressful week,toy was always really really relaxing so I think that'll be good it's kind of like a reward for getting through it but then I have I mean these goodies won't need a week and I feel like we'll be doing a lot in preparation for my boyfriend coming for Christmas so it won't be everlasting back for three more weeks of school and then like columns here and no it's like breach I mean it should be
222,can you talk about the transformation that you see in people,it's it keeps me coming back to work every day you know I get to see them walk in and I get to see that transformation slowly and it's beautiful you know you don't you can't beat that
223,I mean realistically not everyone is a success story and we see its relapse it's a part of recovery but but for most cases though that difficult cases that do a good job and make that transformation when does that usually occur,I think it's different for everyone I mean and we really can't tell who's going to make it by who has a better you know a bigger desire it's a journey and it's this process and so sometimes it happens where you see that light come on sometimes they're struggling and they're discharging and that's that's probably the most difficult part of the job is knowing that someone's not ready to be brought back to their environment and yet that's what has to happen you know it's a transitional period so
224,so they finished the first month of treatment and then it's time to go back to their life because they have to work or they have school or they have kids at home that's what you're talking about that's what's what's difficult or scary for you when they have to leave,yeah because it's you know this is a family disease so when you know you leave that environment that was totally chaotic when you leave like the partner and the kids and the bills and the job and the everything and you remove yourself from that environment may you get popped back into it it's like the people around you assume that great you're finally home because now you can take care of the kids and pick up the you know dry cleaning and you know it's they expect you to be there the way you were and so much more and it's completely unrealistic and you know that they're not willing to change their behaviors if they're still going to be able to drink or have pills or whatever it is and it's it's not okay it's not safe and so that it's a difficult thing
225,is there a strategy that you use that that that you have found to be successful in your experience with maybe that the problem cases are the harder cases,I think that's a common like idea is that oh the ones that have been through treatment a bunch are more difficult or those who have you know just been unsuccessful and they've tried or they've grown up in this environment or that environment and you know it's everyone is different that's why I I personally have a very eclectic approach to each individual and I work with a fantastic team that I can run things by you know people who have stronger knowledge base on certain things so I think everyone has to be approached individually
226,so I guess the message here is that the transition is really important yes the treatment facility is good you could need to go to the detoxification the group therapy but it's also that transition period in every facility I think has a an intensive outpatient program or a sober living environment or at least the referrals that you can get to that so it doesn't just stop after the 28 days it continues and that's I think what we're saying professionally here well actually leads us to the last our last show we we met with the girl named sunny and we're gonna do a flashback here but sunny was basically offered treatment and she she's knows so much about herself she's very good at saying exactly what she feels and she you could just see there was no hope there she basically said look I've been through these programs I helped run these programs I was a counselor and I was going into the bathroom and I was shooting up in the bathroom and I was going out and no one even knew it for weeks and weeks and weeks and so then at this point she's like well I'll try it but why bother at this point I'd been through it all I know myself and we've all been there where we knew ourselves we knew that nothing was going to stand the way of our using we wanted to stop but our head just check something happened in our brains and something happened with with our lives that all of a sudden we would go back to using again and she knew herself but is it always is anyone a lost cause that's it always worth it,absolutely
227,absolutely,my wife Sonny had a period of sobriety and she relapse back in May we have a small child we have two and a half year old son
228,there's always another chance no matter how bad it gets is it possible can we talk to your,15 years and I put my step worth on the back burner and I went out I was shooting dope i was shooting heroin a meth in my neck every day and you know working and treatment trying to work there still you know and it's trying to go to this meeting and be secretary still high you know I said I wouldn't get high at work and you know that I'm trying to find a vein in the bathroom all night I had no mental defense against the needle I stole medication I went to sober living after so we're living I used there and i use there and i use there and i go on until i start doing things that are shady since i realized i've been able to put together more than a week
229,is there a willingness or you are you basically giving up,what's what's gonna do this time you know why is this place gonna be magical
230,so what I'm asking you at this point will you give it one more shot and are you willing to go to treatment,another
231,at this point what do we have to lose you know what's scary,I get the all right
232,thank you so much for doing this i know that it hasn't been easy,no problem
233,how are you doing first of all,i'm doing excellent i feel great
234,there was one part where we actually asked her it was cut out we said you know do you want to go to treatment she says,can I bring my cell phone like I don't know about that but you know I I you went to Spencer Recovery Center and I worked there so I'm able to see the transition as well I don't work in and him with you but Carrie does
235,you know you you were honest about being a manipulator you were honest about the other programs you went to what's it like now for you what was it like what was different about this place,you know I'm not really sure but there is something different I mean I don't know if it's with me or just with my like a psychic kind of change you know going in there except not being out of maybe desperation but just out of my own choice just to be like all right I'm gonna do something different with my life this time and really try and then I had a hard time for a little bit and I really worked with Carrie like to address some of my other issues that might be going on you know other than if I'm relapsing that much maybe there's something else going on with me besides just my addiction you know
236,but you've worked hard it hasn't been easy,no it hasn't I've had some struggles like just mental struggles you know when you get back into mode to a relapse it's like or feel that feeling and then you know if to just pray on it and just like so something else can intervene and like besides yourself you know because i did and God stepped in and took those things away you know like because once you're in that mode it's very hard to once you're locked in a mode that you decided to use or like that you're getting feeling like you may want to it's very hard to get yourself out of that and I managed to pull myself out of that with the help of Spencer
237,why miss Clark my name is Alan Lyme I'm a social worker at the Family Health Center dr. Sheila asked me if I would spend some time with you today I'm really glad that you here I'm just curious as to why he would send you to me,well I came to see dr. Steele last week because of increasing stress and anxiety that's kind of getting the best of me and in the course of my appointment with him he was asking how I was dealing with that stress and I mentioned that my one or two glasses of wine a few nights a week is turning into more frequent in maybe three or four on some nights and he had some concerns about that and and felt like maybe you could help me with stress or something
238,yeah so he he actually see me because he went to him for increased stress and he's concerned that your alcohol consumption may be a part of that increase and prior to prescribing you anything you want to make sure that you had someone to talk to about that,I suppose
239,okay I saw you filled in one of the pink sheets might take a little bit,he told me to fill that out and bring it with me
240,okay thank you so you say here that you have four or more drinks in one week you mentioned that you may be increasing that a little bit as well um and that you have one or two drinks in one setting,typically
241,yeah and maybe monthly you have more than that what what's what kind of drinks do you have what do you drink we need to drive,wine with my meals um you know again one or two typically and more frequently three or four so my stress is increased
242,so starting to increase this times drink a little more okay well based on what you put here you give it gives you six points on this scale scale ranges from zero to forty so six points will put you in what we consider an at-risk zone so if it's okay with you lots to talk a bit about that,okay
243,okay so that was sunset run zero to forty it's not it's not a super high risk but it certainly could be a risk for maybe increasing stress maybe some physical Emmas related to alcohol well could start to show up if you were to increase your drinking from there or you can stay there this is a typical standard drink size over here I'm not sure whether that fits your description of a glass of wine a lot,I fill the glass up so maybe a little more than
244,yeah maybe the little space that it's upside to drink drink and a half each one so that also increased a little bit more so perhaps maybe drinking more than you indicated on here and for women you healthy woman your age no more than three drinks in one setting is considered to be lower or no-risk and 1/7 in one week,so in total
245,how much total in the week and what you say here is that even on this sheet you're perhaps already drinking more than that,mmm
246,so what do you make of all that,well that news to me you know I thought red wine with your meals is supposed to be healthy and you know no more than seven in a week that seems kind of prohibitive
247,yeah it seems it seems a little less than perhaps you've been drinking with what you consider to be healthy drinking and certainly there's this conflicting information out there about what's healthy what's not healthy imagine the increased stresses what because we're concerned or to seal as your stresses increases and if you were to prescribe you anything maybe some interaction between the two but also build and serve them I would think so if you would what is it that you like about alcohol,well you know it does at least in the moment temporarily reduce my stress and I you know like a good glass of wine I don't don't drink the cheap stuff I like the expensive what
248,so you like the taste of it mm-hmm and it does help to lower the stress signal which is for that time you're drinking one of those so good things about alcohol for you,um well you know the nights that maybe I have a couple more glasses than I should I wake up feeling kind of yuck and of course part of my stress is finances and I mentioned I like the good stuff and so if I'm drinking more than I'm increasing my financial burden
249,yeah so your financial stress may be increased by the fact that you're drinking,yeah kind of defeating the purpose there
250,22 the drinking to do stress and increasing stresses so the one hand it lowers it on the other hand it's increasing kind of a seesaw teeter-totter effect then what do you make of that give them that on one hand it lowers and the other had it increases and now it's increasing even more,maybe I need to find some other way to deal with my stress
251,yeah imagine you've had some thoughts of that what have you thought of trying,well I've exercised in the past and that helps right now my schedule is kind of out of whack and I just really don't know what to do that's why I came to see dr. Steele I thought maybe he can prescribe me something that would help me you know when I'm feeling overwhelmed
252,and he may be able to I'm not saying that he cannot I'm just imagine that he's concerned that if you continue to drink on the level that you are drinking that whatever he prescribes you there may be an interaction with the to imagine that she's concerned I'm not completely sure so you've had some success in the past with changing behaviors and if you were to decide to make any changes here it sounds like you could drop all that to make those changes how important would it be for you on a scale of 0 through 10 i below the visual here with that if zero is not important tennis is very important to do something about your drinking way,mm-hmm well I mean if if it means that it's increasing my stress and or he's not going to prescribe me anything because of my drinking then it's fairly important maybe about a 7
253,mm-hmm let's put it up there why do you choose a 7 or a 504,well again I've got to get things under control you know my kids are depending on me and I've got to go to work to help ease this financial stress and so you know all those responsibilities
254,there's a lot riding on your decision in what to do this what if anything will bring up too late online on that scale,um well the you know the risk that you mentioned about the drug interaction I certainly can't afford to you know have any more stress
255,yeah so so you choose to lower your stress rather than increase it and if lo and your drinking would have that effect that something be willing to do right now how confident are you that you could do something about your drinking,I'm pretty confident and you know probably about a seven or eight
256,okay so it's pretty hot up there again and what if what if anything would you choose to do would be to cut down with a bit to quit just in case but,you know I like I said like a good glass of wine I don't want to quit altogether I'd be willing to try cutting that but you know if it's going to if doctor seal would agree to prescribe me something for the anxiety and it meant that I had to not drink at all I'd be willing to do that at least for a period of time
257,so you'd be willing to stop altogether that's what was indicated by the physician okay so so based on that how ready are you to do anything right now whether it's to cut back whether it is to quit,well again you know if I can get something to help me manage if maybe I can find some other way to deal with the stress then then you know I be pretty ready I again maybe about in on that scale maybe an eighth
258,okay so that's that's pretty hot there as well it sounds is that you'll be pretty motivated to do something about this right now given your responsibilities given your children relying at this point and just on on lowering anxiety in general it sounds and that's one of your goals as well well I'm pretty confident that once you decide to do whatever it is you decide to do you'll be able to follow through that based on your experience in the past of of making behavior changes imagine some things that you can draw upon what's one thing that you could do imagine you thought of some things might help to lower your stress,well I you know the the exercise but again that's that's kind of difficult to fit in right now hoping that dr. seal will prescribe something for me to take when I'm feeling particularly overwhelmed and maybe just having somebody to talk to to bounce some things off of
259,one of the things we can't offer here is for you to come in and talk to one of our behavioral health specialists may be able to help you talk talk through this there's a terrible stress and sound like responsibility there and we can make a point for you if you like before you leave today dad talk to someone,that'd be nice
260,right it also has some information here if you're interested some a pamphlet on alcohol and and how what healthy limits are and how it may be affected by medications that you took as well and I wish you lots of luck it sounds as though you really committed to making this shift in this change and imagined doctors still wanna fight with you and see how you do with your with your change within a few weeks again I look forward to speaking to in the future,all right thank you very much
261,so Chris they wanted to talk to you you know you're one of our starter athletes of really value you as a team player as athletic director one of my job's is to kind of keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best and something came up this weekend I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and I understand you were there and so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now,okay Oh actually could I confide something in you that has been bothering me lately well prior to that party like as you know I'm an honor student and my parents did keep me very like kept down out of the lake so like social life and about a month ago my friends they invited me into a party and I used the fact that all I'm always doing my homework and always studying that to allow me to go to the party and um well that party I managed to convince my parents that I would spend the night at my friend's house so I that's when I started drinking it was a unique experience as you could say I guess you can say and I don't know I was fun at least in the moment so I kept doing it then this past weekend instead of studying for an exam I asked my I begged my mom to let me go to another party and she kind of knew what I was doing she asked me to like to promise her no alcohol no drugs man I'll pick you up by 12 and I was surprised twelve was told us basically when the party starts but I told her whatever I thought I thought to myself that I'll come home figure out to delay her call me pick me up later so later so she I promise she dropped me off I promised her no alcohol no nothing so we go I have fun like I've been having and I was drinking and then it's time the time came for her to pick me up and as soon I couldn't delay her for pick me up and as soon as she picked me up and I step in the car she said you drank vodka and I'm like I I didn't know what to say I just looked at the floor and I feel terrible because I I betrayed my mother I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol and that's exactly what I did
262,so here you are you're an honor student you're star athlete you've kind of been doing everything you've been told for all these years and maybe last month sometime you started getting more involved in the party scene and it was fun at first but now you're already noticing some consequence,right like I've been noticing I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork I haven't really I kind of just sit in class like my mind is elsewhere especially on the weekends we're instead about instead of studying I'm caught up with my friends trying to find what we can I get alcohol based on their age and stuff like that
263,it's really changed your focus yeah what do you like about drinking,I don't know it it's I'm a very reserved person for the most part not well not when I'm doing sports but like you know like a social environment I tend to keep to myself because I'm very self-conscious I would say and when I when I drink I feel I don't know like it relaxes me I'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily
264,so helps you kind of used to not feel more relaxed,exactly
265,sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though mom got mad at you you're having decreased focus you're kind of not doing so well in school maybe,China
266,any other things,just different group of friends of group of girlfriends thank you different people that I'm hanging out with because certain people are associated with that type of so that's that that's also changed
267,so your your friends that you were hanging out with there's a little tension there now,a little bit because not all of them are into that so like I'm in one group of friends and I would talk to another person there's another group of friends and they just happened to invite me to that first party so since then I've been hanging out more with them getting to know them but I could also see that oh I'm just living life I guess but that's also not fair to them that I'm not there for them as much as it was before
268,okay,as they are there for me
269,well given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships it's affecting your studying it's affecting your relationship with your mom where do you think you should to kind of go from here,oh I feel I should just stop I mean like I'm not not unrealistic I understand that situations like this will happen
270,mm-hmm,it's just up to me not to take it so far where I can't remember the night before or if I'm puking all I remember is the toilet that's that's not worth it either and I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that's a big blow it's little I guess it may seem to other people like created it it's a big thing
271,your mom is really important to you,of course
272,and how she feels about you is important,exactly
273,how important is it to you to make an adjustment in your drinking or even to quit,a lot at this point because I feel that's a big factor with gaining back my trust with my mother and also getting back on top of my schoolwork again my athletics - okay I feel that there's a feature in that
274,how confident are you that you could actually change or you're drinking or even cut down or quit,I'm pretty confident especially
275,on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all antennas completely when,I'm probably like an eighth of nine I mean I can't be a ten just nothing's a 10 in life I feel like there's too many factors but I feel like I'm determined
276,- why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than 6 or 7,because I don't know I feel - turn to determine - to make sure this happens because I don't like how I felt after I betrayed my mother I don't like remembering that the feeling of like vomiting it's not a pleasant experience it-it's not something that I wish to enjoy so even if I do drink I don't want to drink to the point where that happens like all the fun that I have then prior to that it's not worth it's not worth drinking
277,all right what do you think's a realistic goal for you then,to make sure I have my studies well first try to get get back my trust with my mother then just focus on my studies then if I have time I need your time like oh I'll go party with my friends and just be as I party with them doesn't mean I have to drink and I do one cup is not gonna do anything to my life either but I'd prefer not to do that I prefer just make sure
278,your goal is kind of to not drink at all or if you are at a party a maximum of one at the very most,exactly just so I take part with the social convention but it's not hey guys drop doing though
279,yeah Chris they really appreciate you talking with me about this I know it seems like something it's been on your mind as it is and you know like I said I really care about you as a student and an athlete and want what's best for you so I'm glad we were able to talk about this it really seems like you have a good plan going forward you know really striving for not drinking alcohol at all and if you find yourself in a situation where there's alcohol making sure to have that limit of one drink maximum sounds like something that'll work for you,and thank you for listening listening to me that's me
280,hi n it's good to see you today,hi good to see you too
281,in the session before we were talking a little bit about your alcohol use hoping you could you could tell me a little bit more about that,yeah it's it's kind of him I kind of had some issues this week again - I was I was at a party and I feel so stupid that I was like you know I did not mean to get that drunk I swear I was just gonna have you know two drinks that's what I told myself and I made an idiot of myself I I was an idiot I am oh my god I was completely flirting with my boss's husband like so I was told the next day I'm I would never do that you know and God talking to you about it right now I feel like I could use a drink you know I would I would love to have one right now honestly but you know and you know maybe a part of it I said I was just gonna have two drinks right I had two drinks at the party you know two vodka tonics and I didn't even it was like I had nothing though you know and so I had another and then I guess that's just kind of when I you know I didn't mean to and I feel stupid but you know I flirted with my boss's husband my boss actually thought it was kind of funny the next day thank God it's like not a problem but I'm mortified you know
282,doesn't feel good for you,no that's not how I wanted to actually thought it was hysterical but anyway yeah
283,did you stand out that party is being more intoxicated or was everybody intoxicated,uh you know people were drinking pretty heavy yeah but I mean I'm usually right up there with the best of them you know and really you know there were work people I said to myself I wasn't going to add more than two and I did like oh it's like clockwork but what you gonna do
284,have you ever had any legal or work or social problems because you're drinking,not really I mean I was stupid really I feel like an idiot but um no I mean my boss she said she had a few herself she thought it was hysterical but she did mention it to me you know she noticed that it was funny but yeah no no I mean like people are hanging with this that's how we roll
285,have you ever tried to cut down,not really I mean like I said I was gonna have to but you know if you call that trying to cut down but like I don't say you know oh not gonna drink every night this week or anything like that like I hear some people
286,do you find it difficult to to get alcohol like you have to work to find it no,no no
287,it's easy to find,yeah sure
288,okay how about any type of withdrawal symptoms,not me
289,it's good to see you again,it's nice to see you
290,last session we spoke a little about your alcohol use over the last few months and I want to get some more information on that if you could tell me a little about that,yeah it's um it's not going that well you know after I was here last time I was thinking about what you said and you know I did decide to try you know I decided to cut down a little bit to try to cut down a little bit and it's not that easy
291,no,no like last week I went to I went to a party and I was not I was not gonna drink you know I fully intended not to drink and you know I've got trust I remember going to the party I was gonna meet Amy there and you know next thing I know it's the next morning and you know I'm like nauseous I'm shaking like I'm still shaking he's a jerk right now sorry so anyway yeah it was the next morning and I was so mad at Amy I was like you totally got me drunk and I really thought that and she told me at when she got there I was already drunk you know I went and I I was seriously not gonna have anything to drink scary okay
292,how that one was this,this was like last week
293,this is last week,yeah
294,so last weekend you didn't plan on drinking and you you drink you dragon and more than you it would have normally,oh yeah yeah I mean okay so that's the other thing I was saying to myself was like yeah I'm gonna drink I'm gonna drink two drinks that's it you know that night I wasn't gonna drink anything and I ended up you know completely wasted but yeah like last night at dinner you know my mother-in-law is coming over I was like be cool you know state she'll so I was just gonna have like two glasses of woman right now school idol myself and then you know they hit the Scotch tried God and really want one right now just
295,how long has it been since you kind of drink,honestly this morning
296,this is tough for you,yeah
297,has has this alcohol use interfere any other air in life socially or an employer or anything,no I'm and I mean I'm not working you know home with the kids but the kids are you know in school till 3:00 and you know knowing my friend's party like I do well my mother-in-law's she's just kind of pissed last night I don't know what I said to her
298,so when you're when you're talking earlier you'd mention that you were feeling anxious lucid anxious trouble sleeping look like you're shaking a little bit there was this a result of you cutting back,no no that's the weird part man I I still like I used to be able to if I downed a bottle of wine in you know it would get me totally drunk but like I said last night I had the bottle of wine and I was like lightly buzzed you know so I'm not really well I did try to cut back after I was in here as confusing you know I I did try to cut back I'm really wasn't able to
299,what happened I tried to cut back,it worked for like 15 minutes I don't get it you know I say I'm not going to the next thing I know like I'm there in the friend which I bet the bottle in my hand I watched it happening don't want it to happen and then I'm like oh forget it you know who cares I'm already trying to sell
300,good to see you again hey,it's good to see you
301,our last session we got to speak a little bit about your alcohol use you're telling me a little bit about that but I'd be interested in hearing more I feel comfortable continue with that discussion,I really don't want to talk about it but I guess that's why I'm here yeah my life is a mess I lost my job
302,did you,yeah
303,how did that happen,I went out at lunch with my coworker and we walked by the bar and this woman had a martini and it just looked so good and I thought I was gonna have one you know I said I was not gonna drink at work I was not gonna drink at work you know I saw that martini so I thought I'd have one and I don't know what happened but I know I went back to the office afterwards you know I know that my husband was called to come pick me up and he brought home a box of all my stuff
304,it's a bad experience for him,and now he's moved out I don't have my job he's moved out you know he's got the kids he said I can't be trusted with my kids so you don't
305,agree with my secret,honestly I don't know I mean I was swear I don't have a problem but how am I gonna you know my best friend will talk to me I mean she drinks more than anyone I know and she said I'm going overboard you know she tried to tell me paste want for everyone she has you know so and I don't want to tell you this but I got another DUI
306,and how long was this,this was after he left this was like this is like five days ago and I he left she took the kids I was like what's the use you know and so I just you know I just I was bottle of Absolut in the freezer polished that off and we didn't have any more so I went out to get more
307,hello Pepe how you doing today,okay how are you
308,I'm good thanks for asking I understand you've come here today to the agency because you have a recent arrest,yeah um I got a DUI for being under the influence of alcohol marijuana
309,alcohol marijuana how recently was this DUI,Um about a week ago
310,okay so what's been going on what is gonna happen,um well I am gonna have to go to court soon and I know that I'm probably gonna have to get some type of like treatment or something like that but I really just don't want to so I just I'm just coming here because I don't know maybe I can like get out of it if I'm getting some type of treatment but I don't know
311,get out of it you mean gonna have the charge,yeah I mean I feel like they're probably gonna make me like go to rehab or something like that I want to do that
312,so you feel like you can get out of the rehab part too-,um I don't know I really am Not sure I just know that I don't know getting in getting the DUI is kind of just made me realize I like me to make it change but I'm just not ready to stop drinking or using marijuana there's just like the only things that like really help me in my life
313,all right so with this recent arrest you realize it may be about you to stop using but really don't want to,mm-hmm yeah
314,so you're stuck there,yeah it kind of like I would like realized that like drinking and using marijuana hasn't like got me anywhere positive really but it's like the only thing that like I know I just that's all I do usually and it's all in that mix we ever like feel better
315,when you drink do you ever socialize at the same time,I mean sometimes I'll like go to bars and things like that but most of the times just like that I am at my house
316,alone safety of the marijuana,yeah I mean I'd like a few people that always smoke with but usually just kinda by myself I mean I smoke every day so thought it was with people I'm doing it
317,so doesn't sound like you're really worried about losing your social support if you stop using,no not really
318,what are you losing,I kind of just like use it to like cope I got like I have a brain injury that I got like a while ago like it still causes pain and that's just the only thing that ever seemed to help once after the injury
319,this is the alcohol in there one,mm-hmm
320,so you take it for pain relief equalities,yeah
321,any other reasons,um it's just easier it's just the marijuana like relaxes me it's just easier to kind of like forget about things when I'm using
322,like forget about problems,yeah
323,so it affects your mood in a positive way,yeah like I get like I'd like the feeling once I'm drunk and then if I'm feeling like anxious or anything like that like the marijuana helps with that so then just it's easier to like I don't feel anything so I don't have to worry I don't have to deal with any negative feelings
324,have you used since you had the DUI,um I haven't drank but I've smoked like I've cut back on my smoking a little bit but I'm still using
325,alright it's been a bit of a situation all right so you have the use takes away pain for you it takes away anxiety feels good but then you have these consequences of the law,yeah
326,how do you figure those two things out,I don't know I don't know if there's a way to figure both of my I just know like not I just couldn't imagine not drinking you not using marijuana he had imagined it
327,all right so you can't imagine that so was it at the other side can you imagine having further incensed with law enforcement more charges in the future,um I guess I hadn't really considered that I mean that I don't want there today I guess I would want this to kind of like go as smoothly as possible not get any more charges or anything like that not be in this situation again
328,so you could kind of picture an outcome where you beat these charges or there's not I really have a consequence and you'll be more careful in the future,Um I don't know yeah I guess so I guess I probably just wouldn't drive if I like was just turning like right before try to like avoid that situation again
329,so with that thinking you could continue to use as you were that you would take out the part that got you in trouble,yeah
330,the first you have to get out of trouble this time,yep
331,so if you could have the pain and anxiety go away without the alcohol marijuana would you continue to use it,I just couldn't imagine getting to a place where that wasn't what was like helping me and then to like I don't I drink mostly by myself but I couldn't imagine like if my friends called me up and said hey do you want to go out tonight like not drinking with them
332,so there is a social component here,yeah a little bit I drink mainly by myself just because all my friends work like 95 jobs they don't drink every day but I do but like on the weekends and things like all of my friends who I do have they all do drink all right
333,so you know if you had no anxiety no pain you'd have to give up at least those interactions with your friends how would they respond if you went out with them and didn't drink,um they probably just like wouldn't understand it because we all go out when we got like really drunken I would just feel like out of place
334,so it'd be socially awkward,yeah
335,straining the relationships with your friends,mm-hmm
336,so the quitting and alcohol and marijuana like stopping use that doesn't seem like a good route for you,No not at all
337,but then you have this this recent situation which is making you second-guess some of it,yeah I mean it's making me think that like maybe I I need to like make a change I just can't see that that's the change I'm making
338,so you need to make some change,yeah
339,but not the alcohol and drugs,yeah
340,something else could change,yeah I don't know what
341,you have any theories,I mean I just thinking like just like cutting back on it and like not drinking and driving obviously because that's what like got me into this situation don't like other than that really and I really have really thought of what I could do
342,so you could reduce your usage avoid driving and that might that might get you to your goal would that be enough usage to stop the anxiety in the pain,I don't know it might just not go anywhere ever right not sure drive is often
343,mmm,because I don't know if I would if I'd be able to cut back drinking enough to like not have to like feel okay
344,hmm so that strategy might not work,I guess not
345,that's something you've been tossing around though this idea of isolating a little bit more and drinking a little less seems like all your options here kind of grim,yeah
346,is that just is that just me or does it seem that way to you to,now that I'm like talking through it yeah and I don't think I have any choice really
347,you don't have any choice what's gonna happen it's going to happen,I don't know
348,all right so let's start with early know or pick up with what we know you don't want to make a bad impression in this whole court proceeding with the DUI what do you think you could do that would make a bad person,Um go to court wrong test positive if I get drug tested
349,That would do it,I would do it get another DUI in the meantime
350,that wouldn't look good either all right so you want to avoid those behaviors for sure so you know for sure you don't want it those things would it be acceptable to do those things,I mean not really I mean I think I could avoid the nollie drunk-driving enough or maybe not to drank the day of my court date but I don't know about the whole you marijuana part
351,that's tougher,yeah
352,all right so would you appreciate those as goals like avoiding those situations like going in the court drunk,yeah
353,goals that you could get behind,um I mean I can try I guess so like think about it and try to get out there I know I'm gonna be stressed out the day of my court dates are it's gonna be hard to like not drink that day
354,you're not striking me as overly enthusiastic about this idea,No I am not
355,this is really tough for you the alcohol,um
356,the marijuana that are important to you,yeah
357,this whole DUI thing  it's really just encroached on something you had going on that you enjoyed,yeah
358,so is this an inconvenience that you can move past or is this a major life event that does change things,Um I don't know because I don't know any other like way around it than just dealing with it I mean if I like don't go to court or anything that's gonna warrant out for me like I can't I can't avoid this situation
359,what if as a condition of your treatment the judge says no more drinking in no more marijuana period legacy to that you obey those rules or or jail,I don't know if it would I get to that I know it possibly could that probably will but I I don't know
360,I would think it almost certainly would have,yeah I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't imagine like not drinking and using drugs I'm sure I would like leave court that day thinking I would but I don't know what happened when I get home for the next day or that day
361,let's go back a couple of steps how long have you been using the alcohol marijuana,for about like six years
362,have you ever until now with the DUI have you ever envisioned stopping,no
363,what's your plan like what pre DUI well is your plan in all this,I just I did like the jerking kind of has gotten worse it wasn't always that bad I've always used marijuana but the alcohol is I guess I've been using a little bit more recently so I didn't really ever have a plan the marijuana never really looked affected my life too much but I guess the alcohol has been a little bit more
364,yeah so without this or something you would have continued using yeah for years to come,yeah I didn't really have any like I never like thought I want to stop doing this or anything like that or had a reason to or
365,till now,yeah
366,could this be in a strange way like an opportunity,I mean I guess if I had if I wanted to stop this would be a way for me to stop or a reason for me to stop
367,if you really wanted to stop could you stop,I don't know may I guess I could try but I don't have that one
368,you could give it a shot you're just not sure you could you could actually do it,yeah I mean I've never tried to before so I don't know
369,it's just unknown,yeah yeah
370,so where do you want to go from here you have this DUI I imagine a hearing or some type coming up right here to see me what can I do to help you,um I guess yes help me figure out whether or not like I do want to stop drinking or using drugs I mean that might be something that I have to do right now I don't really want to so I don't know if I could like get to a place where I actually do want to stop it'd be easier to actually do it then
371,like a like a place in terms of your thinking like your mentality,yeah
372,okay do you want to work on that,yeah
373,all right so between now I'm going to see again do you have any hearings or anything coming up,no they're not for like a few more weeks
374,a few more weeks so I'll see you again I know you have the IOP and everything here I'll see you again in a week and let's pick up with that anything changes we're hearing is moved up just snubby now,okay
375,thanks Pepe,thank you
376,come on in,okay
377,hey Larry how are you doing today,fine
378,oh okay alright but before we get started I just wanted to tell you how proud I was a blue and group on Friday night yes that you really really helped Debbie in the role play,I am your boss
379,yeah who's that fuzz it's kind of reverse roles like that you know so I just wanted to tell you that you know the whole group appreciated and you did a great job,thank you
380,okay all right well I gotta say you look a little agitated,yeah well my mother's been bothering me so much about you know all the chores and the laundry and the dishes
381,okay,I just can't stand it I'm so busy looking for a job
382,okay,oh
383,well I tell you what then before we get started in our session let's go through just a real quick breathing exercise just to kind of bring you into the here and now,okay
384,you're not where you were an hour ago you have to worry about an hour from now that's just kind of right here okay can we do that we've done this a couple times in grooving in those practice it now it's sufficient being on the floor there we go put your hands on where you're comfortable you sitting up straight you've comfortable closing your eyes,yes
385,yes all right so let's not clench your hands you go first thing you're going to do is take a nice deep breath and you're going to blow it out slowly through your lips just like you're blowing out the candles on a birthday cake but very slow again to feel the air drove into you sensation on your lips your Grandpa's always your breath is there always there for you to remember that's better you're here and throw it say everything's good so let me ask you question yeah you gonna bring me something or find something,oh that's right oh I found something
386,that you could touch your hole,oh that's beautiful
387,okay so what do you what do you do with it,well this I mean I sometimes I put it just so I can feel it on the back of my neck sometimes I put it in my lap
388,okay,you feel better just you know familiar things
389,oh that's right so we'll go ahead and keep in your lap now you can touch it and help keep you singers and keep you here,okay
390,so now that your little calmer let's talk about what happened with mom before you came here this afternoon,okay well I mean she knows that I'm looking for a job and she knows that I'm going to school and just every time I walk in the door she asks me to do the dishes no matter what and I just we get in a huge argument over well you've been home for two more hours and I've been home so why didn't you do the dishes or why didn't you start the dishes and and we scream at each other and I scream we have screaming matches I always try to scream louder than her and then she gets upset
391,alright so it's back and forth in the situate a situation escalates and you slam doors and,we slam doors and stuff how do I get the impression
392,okay well let's use this situation that has happened to you because today I wanted to actually work on awesome interpersonal would give them and I have a handout sheet to give you and it's called the give technique I want you to take a look at this handout you can take that home with you we're going to talk about this we can directly apply this to what happened today with your mom because this is going to happen again right same situation with your mom so it's a it's a an acronym give giv e why don't you read what those letters stand for,okay G gentle be gentle I interested act act interested the validate e easy manner use amazing manners
393,okay so this is just something that when a situation starts to escalate you can just say give,okay
394,gentle the interested validate and use an easy manner folks it's something it's really short and quick so in your situation with your mother when she started yelling at you about doing stuff if you thought okay G how would that look,G gentle um like it not yellow I could be quieter
395,okay maybe your tone of voice so if you thought gentle that would probably stop in your tone of your voice a little bit and that would be a good response,okay
396,okay that's very good good what about act interested,I'm going to make eye contact with her
397,okay that's important so she knows that you're listening,the intention that you're paying attention
398,right okay that would be something that you could do quickly and easily okay and what about validate it's an interesting word what what might that how might you validate what your mother is saying,I'm I can tell her that I understand that she would like me to help out around the house
399,yes because you know what if you live together is it important that you work together and get everything done nobody likes to do housework but you all have to do it so does she have a good point,yeah
400,can you validate what she's saying that that you do hear what she's saying it's important that you do these things and you know I know that you have a lot on your plate certainly your mother notion have a lot on your plate Taylor right,okay
401,you're dealing with a lot so but you can still validate her concerns -,okay
402,in an easy manner what would that look like for you,um I I mean I kind of aggressive so I guess that could be you know I tried be more light-hearted about the situation if we start getting in arguments like it if we try to tell a joke there's no way I was like and
403,they kind of difficult to tell a joke in the middle of a heated situation its Butthead but,yeah
404,you could you could slow down,okay
405,slow down and maybe stay calm and just think that think of the letter e easy whatever that that word easy would make you feel,okay
406,so what are the three what the four letters again,G I
407,G for,gentle interested validate easy
408,easy okay good good good good so you're going to take that home and you're going to look that over all right okay put that go ahead and put that it,yeah
409,in your workbook so it's a it's a really easy acronym to remember,speaking of acronym I used the stop technique that you taught me
410,you did yeah I want to hear about,the other day
411,oh happy,yep the other day I was in traffic and I was getting on the highway and nobody was letting me in you know everybody was cutting me off I was getting so nervous and anxious because I couldn't get on the highway and then what was going to happen if I couldn't get on the highway and I am with a panic attack
412,oh,and I calmed myself down I stopped
413,stopped is the,S
414,yeah,I stopped I took a breath
415,T you took it breath and kind of like took a step back okay,observe my observe situation I said if I can't get on my Highway I'll just get off I'll get off and then I can get right back on and then P I proceeded with driving
416,oh well I'm so I'm thrilled I'm so happy and it was quick and easy to remember,yes yes
417,how did I make you feel to be able to change a behavior like that because ordinarily you would have been cursing and having that anxiety attack,right I was trying not to do all those things so I thought you know it to stop I just have to it kind of took me over I took it changed my focus and I had that to focus on so I didn't actually stop in the middle the highway but I you know
418,I am so proud of you that is awesome Taylor think I am just that couldn't be happier and wait till we tell the group,oh yeah
419,that is no good that would be so good so one more thing I want to give you today one more tool of your little toolkit it's called the opposites and it actually it's in your workbook if you look on page 233 got it if I know anger is one of your emotions that we're working on when I'm is one of our targets here and this has to do with the opposites and you can actually use some of these opposites when you're doing the give technique or when you're doing the stop technique and what it is is that whatever it is that you ordinarily do in response to situations how you react you do the opposite,ok
420,so we're going to practice this we're going to practice more a group but I want you to kind of get an idea of what it is today so let me ask you a question when you feel angry what do you usually do with your hands,yes
421,yeah kind of tight balled up tan,right
422,so what would be the opposite of that,out to anyone
423,relax we laugh okay so that would be the opposite of that okay so when you feel like going like that okay or or just keep your hands,open
424,okay all right let's see what says your stomach muscles in your chest when you're angry what does that feel like,usual it kind of punched over tight i hunched over
425,so if you want to do the absolute opposite of that what would that look like,sitting up straight stomach relaxed like I'm taking a deep breath
426,deep breath deep exactly it's hard to take a deep breath when you're like that,okay
427,good that's good good good okay what about your face what if what happens when you're angry you're G you're,I clench my teeth
428,you can let your two together and you know Brown in and tight so what would be the opposite of that,relaxed thanks maybe a little
429,maybe a little smile two little eyes you're up to it nothing fake but this is all meant to be behaviors that you do on purpose so maybe you feel yourself like this you can do it all at once,okay
430,and that's something you can choose so got a lot here that you're in your little toolkit for one session so I want you to add this to your homework list,okay
431,go ahead and write this down,okay
432,I want you this week to make a list in your journal of the times that you've used your stock technique you've already used at one so go ahead and you can put that could be your first entry,okay
433,when you used your gift technique,hmm
434,and when you use the opposites of a happening and what I want you to do is first put what preceded what that was happening before you decided to use it for this technique so whether it was an argument your mother or somebody cut you off you know you're getting stressed about a homework assignment whatever happens to be what happened before which behavior you choose to use which skill set you're going to implement and then how do you sell afterwards okay and it made you feel calmer happier got along better with your mother you were able to finish your assignment without anxiety that whatever that happened to be,okay
435,and I also want you to at least once a day do your breathing technique,okay
436,okay even if it's just for one minute just to bring you back into the here and now just to bring you into the present and to know that you can breathe and your breath helps you to remain calm okay sounds good all right it seemed very different than when you walked in here half an hour ago so it's um it's good I'm happy for you to it you're making progress I am very excited for you okay I love your little first scarf ever wish I had one just like it,oh
437,okay,okay
438,go do some good work I'll see you in group,okay
439,on Friday night,okay
440,all right thanks,thanks bye
441,hi Andrea thanks for coming in,thank you
442,so I don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here so I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself basically my job is to meet with all of the students I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going different behaviors that you might be engaging in and thinking about any changes you might want to make for your life if you decide that you do it's not my job to change you I couldn't even if I wanted to that's not my role at all it's really to help you think about you know how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward that sound okay all right so why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself,sure um as you know I'm Andrea I uh I'm a junior I'm in the marching band I played at center sacks I mean yeah I'm also in the little bit of a band geek I play you know the Wind Ensemble and the Jazz Band things like that
443,wow you really are involved in music,yeah
444,when did you start,I started playing about 10 years ago actually
445,Wow,yeah I start on the violin first and then I went on explored a little with the piano clarinet finally found the tenor sax hmm yeah
446,very cool I've always wanted to be good at music all right so it sounds like you're in band and a few other musical ensembles any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun,um you know just hanging out with my friends or go to the beach things like that
447,it's kind of everyday sort of thing okay tell me a little bit about your family,uh well I have one older brother he's about eight and a half old years older than me my parents and I have dog
448,cute what kind of dogs,the golden retriever
449,oh nice,I'm a big boy
450,very fun all right and how are things going in school for you,pretty good grades have been pretty all right still like 3.7 ish
451,okay great so you're doing well what sorts of goals do you have for after college or after high school,I'd like to you know I'd like to of course graduate high school hopefully go to a nice Ivy League school or I mean that might not happen and then I'd like to go on become a doctor study psychology you need to come a psychiatrist or something
452,okay you have some pretty big dreams,yeah
453,it's great that's really exciting to think about that and he's going to be looking forward to the future and those things all right well one thing I'm going to ask you about is um you know different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life whether it's you know their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies things like that so here's a little sheet that goes through just some basic values that might be more or less important to certain people like belonging or sense of community again cultural identity or family friendship modesty religion respect self-determination and spirituality so when you think about yourself which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life,um I think a sense of community and belonging
454,okay,I think those two and um respect respect
455,okay can you tell me a little bit about why you picked those three,yeah well I think the community belonging I kind of related them um you know how I said I was in the marching band I really you know I really enjoyed being in like that team setting of you know being with other people and all working to work together towards that one goal
456,mm-hmm,and then in terms of respect I I kind of view that as one of like my major like rules like I I really do think respect is important to respect myself or respect those around me so
457,okay,I place great importance in that
458,okay great so sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of belonging like you said a sense of purpose anyway and then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing it's not just Authority but respecting yourself respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you okay that's great all right well one of the things I want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends so what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends,um sometimes if you just you know go to the movies go to the beach like I had said or sometimes we just get together someone's house play some board games and hang out
459,mm-hmm and when you're hanging out with friends is there ever alcohol involved,yeah sometimes
460,okay can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene,uh well it's mostly just for for parties or party settings it's kind of to get things going and got everything loosened up as they say
461,mm-hmm and so when you go to parties most of the time there's alcohol there okay and how often do you think you would say you're drinking,I'd say um on a not busy month for instance I'd say about like two weekends out of the month two three
462,mm-hmm so about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink,the days that we drink are mostly like I said they're parties so it's more of that whole partying and dancing and you know having everyone have fun and then when we don't it's a lot more relaxed it's a lot more hanging out playing board games watching a movie it's not yeah
463,so it really depends on what the activity is whether or not alcohols get,definitely
464,okay and do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus and that you're playing board games,I think of them as as different I think you know like in playing board games and things it's meant to be relaxing so it's nice to have like that kind of breather versus with a party it's a lot more energetic it's a after at all it's very draining
465,mm-hmm,but in the moment it's quite fun to dance and have
466,okay so there's sort of pros and cons,oh yeah
467,okay what are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol,um it's you know when we drink we we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not you know everyone's drinking together we're a lot more loosened up and relaxed and not really thinking about stresses or things like that but it can be when it's too much drinking it can be can be obviously bad
468,okay so sort of in the the too much drinking or our times can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol,um a lot of times it will make make people stupid yeah you know people make dumb decisions and things like that we we usually try to be as safe about it as possible so like sleepover friends house and so you know we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group so we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks but um definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're stupid when they're drunk can can be really stupid
469,hmm so you're trying to like you said not engage in really dangerous activities you're trying to stay put you're not driving you're trying to stay with people that you trust but yet it sounds like there's still some some things happening,sometimes yeah
470,can you tell me a little bit about that,well I especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends like we drink too much and we hadn't up like throwing up and things like that that I don't that's not fun
471,yeah throwing up is never fun it's not and how often do you think that happened,for me that's happened to me once it was the first time I ever drank and it was it was a lot and you know what I was doing I was mixing all kinds of weird things I'm just kind of taking anything ever anyone gave me and that didn't end well but after that I have it but I do have friends that that still do sometimes so I'll end up like having to take care of them or something and
472,okay,it kind of put it down around my my fun
473,huh okay so on the one side some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed sort of carefree and kind of let loose a little bit more on the other hand there's a little bit more I guess planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can and then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck your your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend you drink too much okay any other not-so-good things about the alcohol,yeah people can get a little like sloppy I guess like they're all loose like with people and corners doing things that should be done in private and that kind of stuff
474,so you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't mean busy,yeah
475,got it okay all right well you mentioned a couple times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the a dangerous aspect of the drinking why did you make those decisions,I just I you know have an aunt who is an alcoholic so I I see like the issues that are involved and I've seen movies and things I know that drunk driving is an issue so I you know I want to be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like I someone's house or someone's parents home or something but so I like I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I want to limit that and still be able to have fun
476,okay yeah it sounds kind of similar to your your value of respect too so on the one hand you the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start if there's too much then,it sort of defeats the purpose
477,right and then with the respect one of the things you mentioned is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries not sort of cross lines how do you think that the drinking fits in with that,in terms of what in terms of respect I think well in a way I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things I'm putting things in it that shouldn't be there and then but in terms of hot ways I am respecting myself I am I'm respecting myself by like trying to stay in someone's house and like trying to limit my drinking so I don't get to that blacked out like throwing up and everything and try to you know let loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not going to go with some random person I met in - I don't know where to do I don't know what and things like that
478,okay so you're sort of looking for that balance yeah how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit but about crossover okay and what have you come up with it at this point do you have sort of a limit that you stick to or,usually well I start off by make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in it how much is in it so that way I control how much I drink so I'll usually just you know get one of those cups and then make one drink and then I'll try to make it last as long as possible and I'll be like all right this is my one drink and I'm good in that way I still have something in my cup some people aren't going to be like oh here have some more like no I'm good I have mine and I'll still be you know having some to like let loose a little
479,mm-hmm and do you feel like that's working pretty well for you or you sometimes exceed that limit or or what do you think,for the most part it works pretty well because like I said people you know people come asking me trying to pressure me I'll be like no I'm good I have you know I still have so I'm like I'll get some later and then never end up getting anything but sometimes they'll be like hey let's take a shot and everyone's got it around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot and then at that point I'll be like oh well maybe I can take one more and that's when I start you know falling into
480,okay,too much
481,so a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you like,I'd
482,like to make some adjustments to to make it a little smoother okay so kind of thinking along those lines how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself,um I'd like to make sure that I you know in terms of respecting myself of my body I'd like to you know try to drink less
483,mm-hmm,and um you know have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group as a community
484,uh-huh so kind of combined he has goals okay so you're you have a goal it sounds like of actually cutting back on your drinking how important is it to you to work on that goal on on the scale of one to ten where one is not at all important antennas it's the most important thing right now,I'd say about like like a six or a seven oh I like to work on it but you know if I get around to it I get around to if I don't I don't
485,uh-huh well why did you say six or seven rather than like a four,um because I still think it's it's important
486,uh-huh,I still you know like I said I don't want my body tried specially going to my school like I know how things affect your body and also affect your your social and your schoolwork and things like that I know that once I get to college it's not it's not gonna gonna work out being you know drinking every weekend and I'm like trying to wake up early and go to school take an exam I know that's not that's not feasible it's not a good idea
487,yeah looking ahead you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for years now okay well how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to,I think
488,on that same scale from one to ten,I think if I made the decision I was going to for sure then I think definitely like a ten I know I
489,oh wow okay why did you say ten,it's just because I know that once I make the decision I know I can making the decision in the first place okay weather
490,okay and so you mentioned you know quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that,um I'm thinking of maybe like trying to convince my friends without sounding you know dorky or something be like hey you know let's just stay in today like let's not go out or something or just be like hey I'm not like I'm not going to drink today and even if my friends do like being okay with them drinking around me not doing it and then then being okay with me drinking me not drinking and them doing whatever they want
491,so sort of trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking okay does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or,I think so I think it's it's very feasible I think it's possible
492,okay um so I guess we'll talk about less alcohol activities and just making some notes to myself and then maybe I'm reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved okay so that's that goal sounds feasible you said would it be okay if we met in a couple weeks to sort of see how it's going,I think so that's good
493,does that sound like something you'd like to do okay well I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me and you know it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself really ambitious goals and going to medical school and you know becoming a psychiatrist or some some other form of physician you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there and it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a lot of friends who you feel probably would be supportive even if you cut down on alcohol and that you know there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body and your health you school performance and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of drinking too much so yeah you know it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place and as long as you're willing and interested in meeting again and be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going,I'd like to
494,alright great so I'll plan to see you then in a few more weeks,Thanks
495,well let's talk about then how you ended up cutting yourself,I'm pretty obvious
496,so what happened first of all tell me what you did exactly,what you mean what I did
497,well I mean where'd you cut yourself I know you said you cut yourself with a name as always same as always,or your arm
498,yeah,where'd you get your stuff left and right there hug it
499,want to see it,yeah
